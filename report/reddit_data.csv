Apple becomes world's first trillion-dollar company after stock price rise,,13881
Apple‚Äôs Stock Price Reaches All-Time High After WWDC Announcements ,"‚ÄúApple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a $3.1 trillion market cap as of writing. Apple now trails only Microsoft, which has a nearly $3.2 trillion market cap as of writing.‚Äù

Pretty impressive rally by Apple. I think they have presented one of the more marketable and useful presentations regarding how their AI features will help everyday users. Also Apple Intelligence is an elite name.

Apple's Market Valuation Drops Below $2 Trillion as Stock Price Continues to Fall,,2561
Apple stock price below 120?,"Can AAPL get below 120? Is now a good entry? I know for long term investment such small difference do not matter but I am wondering. 

Some good news came out about the labor market which suggests less increase in the inflation rates this year. Is the bear market almost over? What is the common opinion?

New investor here, so any information and advices will be greatly appreciated!

Stock price drops 6% in 3 minutes and no halt??,"Can anyone explain to me why it doesn't halt when the price drops over 6% but when it goes up 2% , like on friday,  it does? This seems like manipulation and I can't think of any reason that this would be happening. Can someone who is more informed on halts please explain it to me like I'm a child? By 9:35, we are down more than 7% and still no halt...



Edit: Thanks everyone for responding. I originally thought that it takes a 5% change but based off the comments, it seems that the halts work in 7% thresholds and in this case would be from the price of market open, not close from the previous day. It also seems that for the first and last 10 minutes of the market open/close, it is 10% threshold. 

This definitely helped clarify things for me, and would explain why it didn't halt this morning, but I still don't understand why it was halting on Friday with less movement.",4182

"Comcast Reveals Pricing for Netflix, Peacock, Apple TV+ Bundle","Comcast, as its legacy cable TV business continues to shrink, has built a new cable-style bundle for the streaming era.

Beginning next week, the cable giant will offer StreamSaver, a package that includes NBCUniversal‚Äôs Peacock Premium (with ads), Netflix Basic (with ads) and Apple TV+ for a discounted price, available to TV and broadband customers in its footprint.

As an add-on to Comcast TV or broadband, the StreamSaver bundle will cost $15 per month ‚Äî a discount of at least 35% compared with price of the services purchased separately. In addition, Comcast will offer Netflix and Apple TV+ to its Now TV streaming-only service, which has Peacock and 40 free, ad-supported streaming TV channels, for $30 per month (versus $20/month without them).

Dave Watson, president and CEO of Comcast Cable, announced the details Tuesday at J.P. Morgan‚Äôs 2024 Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference.

‚ÄúThese are three premium streaming services that are combined in one compelling package,‚Äù Watson said, noting that StreamSaver is focused on boosting Comcast‚Äôs broadband business. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a home run for consumers‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre thrilled to have Netflix and Apple as partners.‚Äù

On a standalone basis, the trio of services would cost $23-$25 per month: The ad-supported Peacock Premium is $5.99/month, going up to $7.99/month in July; Netflix Basic with ads costs $6.99/month; and the standard Apple TV+ plan at $9.99/month.

Watson said the priority for Comcast Cable is ‚Äúinvesting in the network for the long haul,‚Äù in the anticipation that there will be ‚Äúmore streaming, more consumption‚Äù over time.

Comcast chief Brian Roberts first announced plans for StreamSaver one week ago at another investor conference. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years, and so this is the latest iteration of that,‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúI think this will be a pretty compelling package.‚Äù

Bundles aggregating streaming services from would-be competitors have gained new popularity among traditional media companies, which view them as a way to cut customer-acquisition costs and reduce churn (i.e., cancelation rates).

Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have announced a triple-play bundle comprising Max, Disney+ and Hulu, to be available starting this summer in the U.S. (with pricing yet to be announced). In addition, Venu Sports ‚Äî a joint venture of Disney, WBD and Fox Corp. ‚Äî anticipates launching a sports-centered live-streaming bundle in the fall of 2024, pending regulatory approval. There‚Äôs no word on pricing for Venu at this point.

Meanwhile, Disney offers discounted bundles with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ and has pushed to integrate them even more tightly together. Disney+ recently added a tile for Hulu (for customers with both services) and is using the tie-in to promote the bundle. In December, Disney+ will add a hub for ESPN+, providing some free games and programming to those who don‚Äôt subscribe to the sports package in a bid to upsell them.",1686

Apple has gotten so big it‚Äôs almost overtaken France‚Äôs entire stock market,"Apple Inc., the world's most valuable publicly traded business, continues its amazing run, setting historic highs and approaching the market value of France's stock market. With a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, Apple is larger than all but the six largest stock markets in the world. This isn't the first time Apple surpassed Paris in terms of value; they swapped places several times during the previous year's second-half selloff.

The French stock market is likewise at an all-time high, driven by luxury goods giants such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA. This spike followed a mid-summer slowdown but has resumed as data suggests that inflation is decreasing and there are no signs of a US recession.

A comparable economic backdrop in the United States has resulted in a returning rally in technology companies, with Apple rising more than 50% in 2023, adding over $1 trillion to the market capital. This represents a major shift from October when Apple faced pressure over revenue growth and sales in China.

Looking ahead, Wall Street predicts that Apple's sales will re-accelerate in 2024, due to a shown rebound in demand for smartphones, laptops, and PCs. This upward trend for Apple mirrored larger developments in the technology sector amid strong economic conditions and a positive outlook for the business.",1584

"""Not-A-Halt"" Halt Today: Are they all working together to manipulate stock price?","In addition to [""not-a-bailout"" bailouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/134xplv/did_jp_morgan_chase_just_get_a_notabailout/), we may be seeing a **""not-a-halt"" halt** today.

For 5 minutes between 9:51a ET and 9:56a ET, no trades show up on my ThinkOrSwim chart.  ZERO TRADES.  One candle is 9:51a and the next candle is 9:56a on both the 1 minute chart and at the tick-by-tick level:

[1 minute \(left\) and tick-by-tick \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/r2ax76fcq74b1.png?width=4024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd294be94322f5e4c688db693e9be34ad4f28597)

From ThinkOrSwim's Learning Center, ""tick charts represent intraday price action in terms of quantity of trades: a new bar (or candlestick...) is plotted after completion of a certain number of trades (ticks)"".  At a single tick granularity, I should see *every single trade.*

https://preview.redd.it/asastoz1r74b1.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=10ac7df1d1e9ac2d8f531ca44fbc7303f419448f

So, this means no trades for 5 minutes in the feed between 9:51a and 9:56a ET.  Which suggests GME might have been halted, right?

So if we look at NYSE's Trading Halts list ([https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current](https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current)), we should see GME listed if there was a halt.  But, GME isn't listed.

https://preview.redd.it/p1rtla8jr74b1.png?width=3978&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fe4096787ae7cf1e5ad8bf8c722b77f0ac6cb1

Meaning there wasn't a Regulatory Halt on GME today at that time.  And we see halts from both before 9:51a ET and after 9:56a ET when GME just stopped trading for 5 minutes so the list *should* list a halt, if there was one.

# What Happened???

**Can someone explain this?**  Because in the two minutes following this ""not-a-halt"" halt, GME drops \~$0.40 (\~2%) which is a pretty significant reversal of almost half of this morning's gains.

**If this was a ""not-a-halt"" halt where** ***every exchange coordinated to hold off trading on the lit markets at the same time for the same 5 minutes***, then this may strongly suggest they (***i.e., every exchange***) are all working together to manipulate the price.

What are we missing?  What happened?

EDIT:  ~~2~~ 3 commenters below checked Fidelity and said Fidelity showed the same gap.  One commenter suggested looking at TradingView, which also has a gap at 9:53a (right in the middle of this ""not-a-halt"" halt).

EDIT: A throwaway lurker pointed me to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/141g7ak/active_trader_pro_showing_no_candles_between_952/) showing ActiveTrader Pro also has no candles or trades around the same time.

EDIT: And another commenter found the same on Google Finance (though, I'm pretty sure they buy their data from another source).  Still, one would think Google would at least try to source good data so this is just getting more weird.

EDIT: Another commenter found [NASDAQ also shows no trading](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/advanced-charting) during this time.

When Zombie stocks mirror the price action of GME.,,16575
What stocks are the most damaging to humanity?  I‚Äôm going to buy one to ensure the price drops!,"Like clockwork, whatever stock I buy goes down immediately.  Whenever I buy calls, the stock plummets.  If I buy puts, the stock skyrockets.  And if I buy near money calls and puts, the stock trades sideways eating me up.  I‚Äôm single handily responsible for stopping TSLA‚Äôs recent spike having bought short term calls and I‚Äôm responsible for AAPL‚Äôs recent spike over 200, having bought puts.  I held the movie theater stock (can‚Äôt name it in this subreddit) for years and sold it.  Same day, it spiked 50%.  Within an hour.  Literally.  I held 5000 shares of a meme stock that I‚Äôm not allowed to name in this subreddit  at 5 in early 2020.  But I sold for a breakeven.  Within weeks, boooyaaa, trading in the 100s.  I went big on the merger news for spirit thinking there would be no chance in hell a competent DOJ could argue with a straight face that a combined JetBlue and spirit only being the 5th biggest airline was anticompetitive, especially considering we would finally have a competitor to the big 4.  And even if the Biden DOJ was to pursue such a claim to the end, no way a judge would agree that the 5th biggest airline would be too big.  What I failed to consider, however, was my bad luck.  I bought in and it‚Äôs because of me the merger wasn‚Äôt approved.  Lost 75% of my IRA.

Nevertheless, I‚Äôve decided to use bad luck for good.  I have $50,000 I want to drop into a company that‚Äôs bad for humanity to bring its shares down.  Whether it‚Äôs pollution of the earth (oil companies), pollution of the mind (social media companies), evil CEOs (Microsoft or Facebook), or evil companies that put profit over safety, I need suggestions.  Please give me some, I guarantee I will bring down the one I choose.

Warning:  if I think about buying a stock and don‚Äôt buy it, it goes up.  So for those of you who give me good suggestions that I don‚Äôt buy, those stocks have a chance of running to the moon.

So what stocks do u want me to target?

How Apple has silently raised the price of their smartphones,"So I watched today's keynote, when I came to a sudden realization

&#x200B;

Last year, they introduced the iPhone X as a premium model, and the iPhone 8 as the ""next iteration"" and ""regular"" model. This was the first part of the plan.

&#x200B;

Today, Apple announced iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR.  


The highlight of the keynote was the iPhone XS and XS Max, the two phones that hold all of the newest features. These phones were marketed as the newest and greatest, and as the ""next iteration"" of iPhone.

  
The XR, on the other hand, was marketed and described as a cheaper option. Apple is choosing to market the XR as the ""lower-cost"" option. It doesn't have 3D touch, a single camera, and also has a pretty low resolution screen compared to the XS series. The XR, as many people believed during the rumours, is the ""budget model"". (budget with extra air quotes)

&#x200B;

But here's the thing. The iPhone XS and XS Max are being marketed as the ""regular"" models. To the regular person who reads about these new phones, they will see iPhone XS and XS Max as being replacements for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. But that's NOT the case! The iPhone XS series is significantly pricier than the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. In terms of pure cost, the next iteration after iPhone 8 would be the iPhone XR.

&#x200B;

In other words: If you expect to pay the same price for a base model iPhone every year, this is how your purchases over the past four years would look:  


\-iPhone 6s

\-iPhone 7

\-iPhone 8

\-iPhone XR

&#x200B;

Every year before today, the respective iPhone from that year was considered the ""regular"" model.

But THIS year, that price category is being marketed as the ""lower end"" model.

&#x200B;

Two years ago, that price would have gotten you the newest model of iPhone. (iPhone 7)

A year ago, that price would have gotten you the newest phone, but not the premium model. (iPhone 8)

Today, that price gets you the ""lower end"", feature-absent model (iPhone XR)

&#x200B;

Because of clever marketing, Apple has silently raised the prices of their flagship devices. Instead of just raising the prices suddenly one year, they released a premium model, set a precedent, then in the following year, released two models of their flagships, at the price of the premium. Then replaced what was previously known as the ""regular"" model with a cheaper, low end, feature-missing model. 

&#x200B;

So now, your average consumer will most guaranteed shell out more money for an iPhone XS, as they want the newest ""regular"" model. Not the ""lower cost"" option.

&#x200B;

Pretty fucking genius. Can't help but wonder if this is on purpose or not. It sounds almost like a conspiracy theory. Let me know what you guys think!

EDIT: People keep commenting as if I‚Äôm complaining about the prices. Apple can charge whatever they want. I‚Äôm simply stating the genius marketing psychology Apple has employed. It went right under my nose until I analyzed everything. Also, thank you stranger for the Reddit gold ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT EDIT: People keep asking how this is ‚Äúsilent‚Äù. Well, if Apple were to just raise the prices one year, the media would go abuzz and you wouldn‚Äôt hear the end of it. ‚ÄúApple raised the price of their smartphone!‚Äù. By employing this strategy over the past two years, the eventual move to $1k+ flagships and ~$800 ‚Äúlower end‚Äù models went under a lot of noses.",5681

$NVDA Justifying $850 Stock Price,"***Back-of-the envelope analysis***

Going full port (though I don't have much) on $NVDA earnings after Tuesday's CPI release. My guess is market sells down quite a bit on Tuesday, either way, don't need to take that gamble. This would be consistent with NVDA trading down just before earnings pop as shown in the 1st two screenshots. Multiples show it's undervalued. It may actually take the next 30 days to trade up to FMV on a multiples basis. Targeting a range of $750 to $850 in the near-term. $1,000 long term is not out of the question.

Thoughts on the analysis below?

I took my gains over the past months and inserted them all into Apple over the past 3 days. My bet is that it will be the simplest way to out preform the s&p500 going forward.

EDIT: A lot of people noting low growth recently, my counter argument of course is that apple growth comes in cycles. My bet is that the AI release cycle comes later this year. As a reason to upgrade all of your devices to use it optimally.

A few others argue its not a value stock. My argument is that it is a value stock at current prices.

The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.

"Losses of Apple, Amazon and Facebook bring down stock market"," 

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

Traders are looking to find an appropriate valuation for technology stocks and assess the health of the US economy as the coronavirus pandemic progresses after killing more than 180,000 Americans.

While the tech industry is generating huge profits during lockdowns, there is also evidence that high-profile companies are overbought.

Elsewhere, emerging market stocks fell for the third day. European stocks plunged. Asian stocks fell, with the Australian index registering the biggest drop since May. Meanwhile, the Ibovespa faced declines of more than 3%, and risks losing 100,000 points again.

Exchanges Working Together With FINRA To Help Control Stock Prices With Trading Halts,"The NYSE Group, on behalf of a bunch of exchanges and FINRA^(1), just filed a ""Joint Industry Plan"" \[[PDF](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-25543.pdf), [Web](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/21/2023-25543/joint-industry-plan-notice-of-filing-of-the-twenty-third-amendment-to-the-national-market-system)\] to basically limit price movement with more Trading Halts (aka ""[Trading Pause](https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-increases-resiliancy-during-extreme-volatility)"" or ""LULD"", Limit Up-Limit Down). You know it's going to be good when it mentions ""meme stock episode"", *twice*.

The introduction of this Joint Industry Plan says it's going to assign all exchange-traded products (""ETPs"") to Tier 1, except for single stock ETPs, which will be assigned to the same tier as their underlying stock.  (A complicated way of saying everyone goes to Pier 1, except kids who go with their parents.  Uhh, yeah... so everyone to Pier 1.)

[Eyes Glazing Over](https://preview.redd.it/6taj4empwq2c1.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65856705080a90e84d6cb37f8599ccaf66f00c4)

That sounds boring AF which signals to me that there may be something hidden inside.¬†

# Price Control

The ""market wide **limit up-limit down** mechanism \[is\] intended to address extraordinary market volatility \[...\] i.e., significant fluctuations in individual securities' prices over a short period of time"" \[[link](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-25543/p-10)\].¬† ""Extraordinary market volatility"" and ""significant fluctuations in individual securities' prices"" sounds like the MOASS we're looking for!

[LULD to address extraordinary market volatility because of events like the 2010 Flash Crash \(May 6, 2010\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek2kfbbtwq2c1.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=5281870e4ba8ac2afef5f332109a8a8299b8c1ca)

As described by the Participants^(1), the ""market-wide limit up-limit down \[\] prevent\[s\] trades ... from occurring outside of the specified Price Bands"". \[Id.\] ***That sounds a lot like ""we're controlling the prices to make sure they don't move too much"".***

So let's look at what this price control looks like. According to ""the Plan"", the Price Bands are based on a percentage (%) from the average (specifically, the [arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean)) of the stock price over the previous 5 minutes.¬† *Basically*, a stock can't move more than ¬±X% over a 5 minute period^(2) before getting halted.¬†

[Price Bands based on a Percentage Parameter \(¬±X&#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/t7vdrzg0xq2c1.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ecc596c048f220616ad418e115b721e183b8fc1)

The Percentage Parameters are **smaller** for Tier 1 stocks with a 5% Percentage Parameter than Tier 2 stocks' 10% Percentage Parameter.

[Tier 1 \(5&#37;\) vs Tier 2 \(10&#37;\)](https://preview.redd.it/eext8l6kxq2c1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20195e43747bfc5104b2ca3e126a3eee2690778)

The Tier 2 stocks that will be moved in to Tier 1 by this proposal are not in major indices and/or are *traded with lower volume* with a consolidated average daily volume (""CADV"") of under $2M.

[Tier 1 stocks are in major indices or trade over $2M CADV. Everything else is Tier 2.](https://preview.redd.it/wwydjgpbyq2c1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=50995005a34a2e748d4f7478a85c094631fe30ca)

As this proposal moves all Tier 2 stocks into the narrower ¬±5% Tier 1, all stocks can only trade a max of ¬±5% before getting halted whereas stocks that were in Tier 2 before could trade ¬±10% before getting halted.  ***Tighter Price Controls*** at a narrower ¬±5% instead of ¬±10%***.***

[Tighter Price Controls, basically.](https://preview.redd.it/2jif1oyxyq2c1.png?width=1832&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffce62f1ddc24ab686a6b3e20a0d607336f18785)

The result of tighter price controls is more Trading Halts allegedly ""beneficial for investors"".

[Tighter Price Controls with more Trading Halts](https://preview.redd.it/mhm2bhamzq2c1.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=8276b4b9640d912b456c86c7148521a02a197f6f)

Let's be realistic when they talk about something that ""may be beneficial for investors"".  There are basically two kinds of investors: ""Smart Money"" and ""Dumb Money"".  Wall St vs everyone else.  This proposal doesn't say it may be beneficial for *all* investors; so it's very likely only beneficial to *some investors*.  Probably not ""everyone else"".

As this proposal was made ""\[a\]t the request of market participants"", I'm guessing it wasn't Dumb Money market participants requesting.  I didn't even know we could even ask for something as a Dumb Money investor.  And I'm guessing you Dumb Money apes also didn't know we could ask the exchanges to change these Trading Halt rules.

[Smart Money needs protection.](https://preview.redd.it/sxiiddin1r2c1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=755841363927b56b4a35db6e7fb257c223cfac8a)

If it wasn't Dumb Money, then that means the Smart Money market participants are asking the Participants^(1) to change the Trading Halt rules for ""protecting investors from the harm caused by sharp moves in ETP prices when execution prices diverge from their indicative index value"".

>The Participants undertook this study at the request of ETP issues who are concerned about **protecting investors from the harm caused by sharp moves in ETP prices when execution prices diverge from their indicative index value.**

*You read that right!*  Smart Money investors want to be protected from sharp moves in stock prices!  **(Smart Money needs protection from MOASS!)**

Because the *current price discovery process* is really more like price control and *tighter* price controls are needed to prevent execution prices from moving too far away (""diverge"") from what Smart Money has decided the stock price should be (i.e., ""their indicative index value"").

**ü§Ø Smart Money Needs Protection From Actual Price Discovery! ü§Ø**

# Cherry-Picking Data For Tighter Price Controls

In order to sell this Plan for tighter price controls, the Participants^(1) need to provide some cherry-picked self-serving data; *specifically including the ""****meme stock episode in early 2021****""* (along with some other unmentionable events).

[Volatile market conditions including \\""the meme stock episode in early 2021\\""](https://preview.redd.it/9u3t0uk1dr2c1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b53c559b7b593c6ac38355a8606e71e1c093a1)

Of these periods of unprecedented volatility, 2020H1 had the most trades outside of the Tier 1 Price Bands as a result of an unmentionable spreading globally after its identification in 2019Q4.  The second highest number of trades outside of the Tier 1 Price Control Band occurred with ""**the meme stock episode**"" in 2021H1.

[Volatility Measured By Trades Outside of the Tier 1 Price Control Band](https://preview.redd.it/qqx03birhr2c1.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc25e854afdbc86cab17632de1faff9289583b0d)

Measuring Volatility By Trades Outside of the Tier 1 Price Control Bands definitely seems like a *unique* metric chosen specifically for this proposal.  This metric basically assumes that any price movement beyond the price control band is *excess volatility* that simply shouldn't exist and that exchanges need to control.  The Joint Industry Plan is for narrower Price Bands to prevent and control any unnecessary excess volatility that ""may occur due to transitory gaps in liquidity"".

[Narrower price bands protect \\""smart money\\"" from inferior prices due to liquidity issues](https://preview.redd.it/8udbjrr1jr2c1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d346cc26d10aa5b661cdf90761e1742f39a271)

Interestingly, the Participants^(1) even admit that Trading Halts would be less useful if, for some reason, stock prices kept moving away from the ""indicative index value"" peg.

[Trading Halts less useful if prices keep moving away from their peg](https://preview.redd.it/pms5z9sdjr2c1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=49a20828cd5b2c2912029e71121ae241f9c512cb)

But curiously, prices tend to revert *back into* the narrow bands.  Either the ""indicative index value"" peg is *extremely accurate* or something else is happening during Trading Halts to move the prices back into position towards their peg.

[Wait... why do prices always tend to revert back into the narrow ¬±5&#37; Price Bands?](https://preview.redd.it/29b9gw05kr2c1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=1673e5eac419fe7c309407a2905c37be554f1a34)

# From ""Halt Me Baby One More Time"" To ""Halting MOASS?""

I've always assumed that no amount of Trading Halts could matter for MOASS because when trading is halted nobody, especially retail, can sell; so there's no way for shorts to buy shares from paper hands.  But now I'm not so sure because this **Joint Industry Plan** says Trading Halts *somehow* allows stock prices to *magically* move back into their narrow Price Bands.  ***How???***

TIL that trading can still happen during a Trading Halt; just not on the exchange^(3).

>Overall, our results suggest that **off-NYSE trades during NYSE trading halts** provide significant price discovery and may lead to more efficient post-halt prices.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The **NYSE halts impair the ability of traders to obtain liquidity** and thus we observe a **shift of trading to off-NYSE venues during the halt**.  
>  
>\[[The Informativeness of Off-NYSE Trading during NYSE Market Closures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228427223_The_Informativeness_of_Off-NYSE_Trading_During_NYSE_Market_Closures)\]  
>  
>We find that **trades routed to off-NYSE venues during NYSE halts** are associated with significant price discovery and lead to an improved post-halt trading environment.  
>  
>\[[When a halt is not a halt: An analysis of off-NYSE trading during NYSE market closures](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinin/v20y2011i3p361-386.html)\]

Somehow, these off-exchange trades are moving stock prices back into the narrow Price Bands.

**ELIA:** Trading Halts enable backroom trades to move stock prices *back* to where the casino bookies decided to peg a stock price.

**If we are ever to have actual price discovery, we** ***must*** **understand (and fix) how off-exchange trades during Trading Halts move stock prices back under control.**

We need to quickly figure out **how to comment** on this proposal or we're going to find ""Smart Money"" getting ""greater investor protection from temporary liquidity gaps"" to ""more effectively dampen volatility"".

https://preview.redd.it/g5gac0dbzr2c1.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=bedce8558d5024afa9d0cd614a090fddad150f40

And, with all due respect to those regulating our markets, **volatility is necessary in a fair and orderly market**.  Eschewing volatility for stability by limiting price discovery has resulted in an inherently unstable system.

Long tail black swan market events highlighted in their Study Data *should* result in volatility.  AFAICT, this Joint Industry Plan is to protect Smart Money investors from their own stupidity; when they should've known better (and probably did) but never thought they'd get caught.  *(Can someone work that into a comment for this proposal please?)*  .

Apple Silicon Macbooks are just hands-down superior to similarly priced Windows laptops.,"I just recently got a Macbook Pro 14"" M2 since I'm traveling so much, and damn. I'm spoiled now. Every windows laptop I've ever used is made of trash by comparison. The build quality and the parts where the machine interfaces with the human- keyboard, trackpad, display, etc. are all better by miles. Battery life is great, and it's quiet while being fast as hell.

Obviously there is some software that is only on Windows and gaming isn't really that easy depending on what games you want. But the title still stands My last Windows laptop I bought was for gaming- Comparably priced to the $2000 MBP I have now. But the usability is still so much better with the MBP.   


I have been mostly a Windows user since Windows XP, and I've owned at least a dozen computers and some of them were laptops. I had an Intel Macbook Pro in 2015 and wasn't impressed too much by its performance, but the hardware was still great. My Mac mini 2020 base model M1 is probably the fastest and most effective computer at it's price point basically ever, even with its limited 8GB of ram.

When the day finally comes that I can game full-time on a Mac is the day I ditch Windows forever (outside of work where I have Windows specific software, bleh.)",956

DD - The anchor. The stock that can predict the future price of GME,"For tonight's DD, I want to talk about October 13, 2021 and the days surrounding it, as well as what happened since.  On or around this day was the day that broke the meme basket and sent 2022 into a heavy downwards spiral for most of the meme stocks, but surprisingly enough, not GME

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ajmbxb5b5hs91.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=983ea5a62f85a1221600c20870c3f02553318961

Pretty normal enough, right?  This doesn't have any significance whatsoever... right?

Wrong.

&#x200B;

Up until 10/13/2021, if you asked me at 9:31est each morning what direction and magnitude GME would move for the day, I would be able to accurately tell you 90% of the time.

&#x200B;

I am not a visionary and do not have access to any of the information you don't have, but there is a silly thing in the stock market that appears to be in these types of 'swap baskets' that I will call an anchor.  This anchor is a stock with very low liquidity, which can be easily manipulated in Pre-market and throughout the day to give tells on what the other similar stocks will do for that given day.

&#x200B;

Let me show you an example of our anchor...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8fh3ggxj6hs91.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=d137342ae344c86fa59d98861a58e4a64a46e182

This stock is extremely illiquid and has been a part of the 'meme' basket since the beginning, even though there is almost 0 trading on it.  Up until the Jan 2021 sneeze, I would have been able to estimate the closing price each in the morning relatively confidently.  The overall correlation in price between these two stocks from 2015 through Jan 2021 was .947.  This is incredibly high correlation and has been going on for years.  Know what the correlation factor is from the sneeze through today??? .947.

&#x200B;

This doesn't let me know the closing price at 9:31am though...

&#x200B;

The method on how I could do this is by looking at the difference between open and close from the previous day.  If the stock opens at a higher price than it closed the previous day, the closing price would be less than the opening price.  If the opening price is lower than the previous close, the price would close higher than open.  This also kept a similar magnitude of movement.  If the price was something like +10% at open, you would know that it would be a blood red day for the meme basket.

&#x200B;

Let me show you an example of the day vs night trends for this stock.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w2x0910v7hs91.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=4737708c65ca9729b5fb8969241e8ee9ba54c0f9

As you can see, the nighttime and daytime movements for this stock very closely mirror each other.  The two prices have a correlation of -.7 (strong negative correlation)

&#x200B;

Here is the day/night trends since the sneeze:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5h84yejahs91.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=2721a2edee118d45bf5f109236a0de299bbec915

As you can see, the jan 2021 sneeze broke the trend for this stock

&#x200B;

Here is the price of this stock vs the towel stock.  As you can see, something weird happens around that timeframe.  There is an insane volume spike of roughly 3x the entire 4.2 million share float, and towel stock makes a very strange dip straddling that insane volume spike.

&#x200B;

Let's see what happens to the other meme stock in the basket?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9h1nqra1chs91.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbc44520815ad89e1acce58604551c617ec712d6

Last night, I did the math on what a dilution trendline would look for this stock if the dilution was done in the form of naked shorts.  You can check my post history to look at that if you want... but I basically said that in Jan 2021, the 400 million share offering completely closed all naked shorts in the system, then the stock was steadily diluted at a rate of 7.5% until october/november of last year.  After that point, BAM! 30%-50% of every single share traded is a naked short to the tune of 5 billion naked shorts in less than a year.  This inversion happens exactly when the headphone and towel stock make their extremely weird spike and valley.

&#x200B;

Now what happened to GME?

https://preview.redd.it/b9fe6aiedhs91.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=510f9f4cf262eec8197b6a50b80607ec5d193f0a

The wedge broke.

We have since been looking at ""critical margin lines"" and other technical data, but it looks like the towel and headphone stock incident broke whatever trends that were going on and caused the entire basket to start falling within days.  I believe the reason GME is falling less is because DRS is propping the hell out of the price, while all dark pool shares are being diluted to a tune of 30%-50% total volume just like the other stocks.

&#x200B;

My question to the sub is: wtf happened here??  Do we have some fundamental event that would cause this?

I do have one more interesting point to leave off with:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7f75be5aehs91.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=efbf7d6c0f39a7ea144e750e208ebf51a8b1a71e

&#x200B;

Starting somewhere in Late May 2022, headphones stock RESTORED the inverted night/day relationship!  I have recently been tracking the relationship and it seems to be fully restored.  Better yet, the two stocks still track each other to a correlation of  >.90!

&#x200B;

The price spike in June only happened with GME and that was the same date that the inversion link with headphones was restored.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vmw11kn9ghs91.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=45226d980c81fdbbe6ec4cfa306578fd1974e554

I tracked the price this week on towel stock and it went 5 for 5 on guessing the closing price of itself and GME.  Obviously the sample size was not large enough to be significant, but it is definitely something I will continue to track.

&#x200B;

As always, please tear apart my theory and let me know your thoughts.

&#x200B;

TL;DRS - Headphone stock appears to be an anchor for GME and can potentially be used to predict future price movements.

Edit:  I really want to know what the overnight futures contracts look like among all the basket stocks.  When futures for one stock go wild, the entire basket responds as well.  If this stock is linked to the collective futures contracts, it is likely a leading indicator.

Edit 2:  I do not believe this stock controls gme.  Since it has no options, we can get a window into the overnight futures movements since it shares the same basket with gme.

Lemon-Musk interview: Musk teases Tesla flying cars w/ SpaceX. Stock is up 6%. Are flying cars baked in the stock price?,"""*Billionaire Elon Musk has teased the possibility of producing a commercially-available flying car as the next generation of Tesla vehicles.*

*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster‚Äîthe car manufacturer's original design‚Äîwhich is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla‚Äîso you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype‚Äîwhich received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors‚Äîwas in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.*

*However, no company has so far been able to secure regulatory approval for a flying road car, which would come with safety requirements and considerations that ground-based vehicles do not have to meet. For Tesla to bring a flying car to market, it would need FAA certification under the agency's adapted regulatory framework.""*

***What We Know***:

*Musk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter‚Äîa platform which he now also owns.*

*At the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around ""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around \[the\] car"" that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...""*

*In 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds ""before adding \[the\] rocket thruster option.""*

*Then late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had ""radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,"" adding: ""There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""*

Today I received a mysterious Fedex package with one share of Apple stock from 2004. Wondering how to proceed.,"When I got home from work today I had a package from FedEx. Inside the package was a certificate for 1 share of common stock from Apple Computer, Inc. dated 2004. Stapled to the certificate is a letter from National Financial Services LLC.  The letter reads,

 ‚Äú Dear Customer, National Financial Services LLC has received and reviewed your deposit request; however, we are unable to complete this request for the reason(s) stated on the reverse side of this letter. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a customer service representative.‚Äù

On the back of the letter there is a check mark on a box that says, ‚ÄúCertificate(s) have been escheated to the state.‚Äù  It also gives me a number to call which I plan to do tomorrow during business hours. 

I am not sure that this stock was meant for me. On the back of the stock certificate there is a box for the social security number of the assignee.  This SSN does not match mine. 

I‚Äôm assuming someone would do their due diligence before sending this to me?  Think it is meant for me?

Any chance this is a scam? Any chance this WAS actually meant for me? Any advice on how to proceed?

Thanks.

Edit: consensus seems to be that this is a scam. That was my first instinct. Thanks for all of the replies. 

Update: I called Fidelity (they manage my 401k and IRA). The guy I spoke with confirmed that they had no record of sending me anything. He also told me that the primary mailing address for them is in Cincinnati OH. The package was mailed from Jersey City NJ. He said it‚Äôs safe to throw it out.

Update 2: I called Apple Investor Relations (computershare). They verified that the certificate number was valid and that it was associated with my name. They also verified it had been escheated by a state but would not tell me which one. They did confirm that is wasn‚Äôt one that I live(d) in. I went to missingmoney.com and there are two properties with my name (over $100) with Apple Inc as the reporting business. I emailed the treasury for that state asking for some clarification.

Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'I Do Think Price is a Factor' in Declining iPhone Upgrades,,7359
Apple Inc. Faces Steep Decline in Stock Price as Q4 Sales Projections Wane,"In a surprising turn of events for tech giant Apple Inc., the company's stock price is poised for a significant downturn in the final quarter of 2023. 
The just broke it‚Äôs 4 days winning streak and the volume is much lower than normal.
Numerous indicators, including a decline in projected sales and worrisome economic factors, suggest a challenging period ahead for one of the world's most valuable companies.

The Google search engine lawsuit also weighs heavily on the company and it can cause a significant earnings drop if the arrangement was to be cancelled. Apple has not yet launched any major AI enabled capability and the sales volume for the newly launched IPhone 15 look dismal. Chinese customers are cautious and the recent ban on government officials carrying iPhone is also causing a dip in the demand.

Apple's Q4 2023 sales projections have fallen short of expectations, sending ripples throughout the financial markets. Analysts, who previously anticipated a robust quarter, have revised their forecasts downward, citing multiple factors contributing to the decline.

The latest sales figures show a dip in iPhone sales, a critical source of revenue for the company, primarily due to market saturation and consumers holding onto their devices for longer periods. Moreover, supply chain issues have constrained product availability, resulting in delayed launches and unfulfilled demand.

Several economic factors are also contributing to Apple's woes. A recent hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has tightened consumer spending, impacting the purchasing power of prospective Apple customers. Rising inflation has made Apple's premium products less affordable for consumers, creating a headwind for sales.

Furthermore, global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade disputes have disrupted the company's international market operations. Supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions have driven up production costs, further pressuring Apple's margins.

As of October 11, 2023, Apple's stock (AAPL) is trading at $178.39 per share, a significant drop from its 52-week high of $198.23. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted to 29.98, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's future growth prospects. The company's market capitalization now stands at $2.79 trillion.

Looking at technical indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, traditionally considered a bearish sign, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure.

Investor sentiment is undoubtedly shifting. While Apple has long been considered a safe haven for investors, a growing number of shareholders are expressing concerns about the company's ability to sustain its historic growth rate. The sentiment is reflected in the significant increase in short interest over the past month, as more investors bet on the stock's decline.

Apple Inc. finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a multitude of challenges that are impacting its sales and stock price. With declining sales projections, economic headwinds, and a changing investor sentiment, the company's stock price is likely to experience a sharp decline in the coming quarters. Apple's ability to adapt and navigate these challenges will be closely watched by investors and market analysts worldwide.",23

RC bought 6.8 Million Shares of Apple in June 2020 (Average Price in June $85) = $578,000,000

If he sold his initial investment in Apple, $578,000,000, this past week, that would be 3,211,111 of his 6.8 Million shares. 

Long term capital gains tax on $578,000,000 would be 20% or $115,600,000, leaving him with **$462,400,000**

If we assume RC is the one buying shares, and increasing insider holdings by 5.2%, he would be buying them from the free float which is 62.98 Million Shares (according to Market Watch).

62,980,000 x 5.2% = 3,274,960 Gamestop Shares.

Is Apple intentionally keeping the stock price down?,"As the headline suggests: welcome to speculation-territory.

I was wondering what is going on in Apple stock since 2023 in comparison to the other ‚ÄöMagnificent 7‚Äò - yes we didn‚Äòt have any major breakthroughs to push revenue significantly higher - but the question i was asking myself: is this intentionally or is Apple REALLY out of ideas (i don‚Äòt think so).

In regards to the DOJ Lawsuit, it wouldn‚Äòt be a stupid strategic move to push the stock price lower to change the view on Apple. Wouldn‚Äòt it be more likely that the DOJ say ‚ÄûApple is a anticompetitive Monopoly‚Äú, when the stockprice would have outperformed the other Mag.7 & Apple is by far the most valuable company?
Now Apples move is to dive into cloudy water to mix up with the other average-performing ‚Äûfishes‚Äú, to offset the view on their business & valuation.

The PRICE of the stock will also SPLIT depending on the ratio of the dividend. This really important for apes to grasp.,"Hi guys, i think many apes don‚Äôt understand that the price of the stock will be adjusted to what ever the stock dividend/split ratio is after a set date. 

I have been reading a shit ton of DD and comments on a stock split or stock dividends across many different finance subs, and i see a lot of you arguing that the price of the stock stays the same ‚ÄúbeCaUSe its a sTock dIviDend‚Äù 

Just think for a minute ape, lets say you have bought  100 shares of GME at the price of $130, that means you have spent $13,000 in total to buy those shares. 

Now the company comes along after approval from shareholders and announces that they‚Äôre doing the stock dividend by the ratio of 7:1, so that means that your shares are multiplied by 7, example, 100 x 7 = 700 shares, you now have in total 700 shares. That means that your brokerage account will be credited with 600 shares, i say 600 because you already have the other 100 shares, so the total comes to 700. 

Now if like many apes seem to think, the price doesn‚Äôt split with that ratio and stays the same at $130 after everyone got their dividend, that essentially means you are getting $78,000 of free money (600 x $130). If your originally spent $13,000 to buy those shares then by this logic you will automatically out of thin fart air have $91,000 in your account, without even moving a muscle. 

Does that make any sense to you ? 

If that was to happen, literally the entire stock market across the globe would come down in a steamy pile of shit. 

I just thought i should put this out there so a-lot of people are not shocked and scared when they see the price drop drastically. I feel like a lot of people need to read this or maybe I‚Äôm wrong i don‚Äôt know. The price dropping in relation to the split ratio is 100% natural.

Many apes have suggested that i also state the positive side of this situation. The positive side of this situation is that if the current price of $127 is split by 7 then it means you can buy a full share for $18 dollars, and i think many people will buy at that price. Hence making the price of the stock go right back up, plus you have a lot more share now if you bought before the dividend date. However nothing is ever guaranteed in terms of price movement, just do your research and make your own investment decisions and strategies. 

 Not financial advice.

Because if a-lot of people freak out over the price drop it could be drastic to them, after they realise they have fucked up. Not financial advice.

Edit: also if you want to go on other subs or even on this sub and argue with people that the price wont be effected, please know that you look like a absolute fucking retard and also make the rest of the GME shareholders look like bunch of retards.

Edit: by the sheer amount of retardation in the comments, it seems this shit definitely  needs to be pinned to the top of the sub. üòÇ fuck sake people.

Edit: reading the comments. I‚Äôm honestly disgusted and disappointed deeply by some of you, the amount of people that didn‚Äôt know this is mind boggling.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

EDIT: the mods have banned me for 7 days because apparently I was to harsh on some retards üòÇ other wise i would reply to those people who are genuinely asking good questions. Apologies.

Another Edit: last edit i promise lol. Fuck me thats a lot of edits. I just wanted to thank everyone who brought this thread to the top so people could realise and learn. Have a good day. I hope everyone gets rich from this journey, no matter how retarded you are.",7947

Adam bashing and anger over current stock price,"I have been in this play since May '21, initially for MOASS and now as long term hold. I have followed very closely AMC's quarterly results and attended every earnings call. There has been periods of total buy in with AA's strategy and times I questioned, but results and numbers speak for themselves.

Little review: during '21 run-up Adam was savvy enough to seize on opportunity to raise $1.8B at a time when company operations were burning $200-$300 cash every quarter. Adam knew at that burn rate company would deplete reserves far ahead of his profitibility projection (FY24-25). He sought to increase authorized shares, giving him means to raise additional cash but apes refused.

To get around our very shortsighted decision to cut off his means of raising capital, he and the BoD created APE. Placated apes with1:1 dividend we had been clamoring for despite huge quarterly losses and sold remaing shares for $400M cash raise. 

Adam saw again that cash on hand was not going to get us there and prospect of insolvency was dangerously close. Short sellers had tanked APE and retail wouldn't hear of further dilution. His ability to raise cash was cut off and was forced to act to save company. Decision was conversion of APE to AMC and RS to free up shares to again raise much needed cash.

Sell Off: looking rationally at what happened you see that Adam's decisions have nothing to do with where stock price is today. 60 days ago, as AMC was looking at chapter 11, market priced AMC at $7.5B market cap or $4-5/shr pre RS. Since that time Adam has removed bankruptcy as a threat, raised $325M with cash on hand at $750M, landed Taylor Swift and Beyonce which expect to blow up quarterly revenue records. 
With all those positives, market now says AMC is only worth less than $1.5B market cap or $0.80 pre RS.  This price is not rational nor connected to companies current condition. This was result of short seller attack and blantent manipulation. Not because of any decision made by mgmt.

MOASS: Adam has said on many occasions that he sees no evidence of naked short selling or synthetic shares in AMC stock. Knowing that CEO's have to be very careful about public statements or things that could be interpreted as trying influence stock price. He clearly doesn't buy into DD nor as CEO would ever do anything to trigger or blunt MOASS. To continue the expectation that Adam is with us on this MOASS play doesn't understand the obligation of CEO...always act in best interest of company.

Adam brings a great amount of value to AMC in his lifetime of experience, business acumen and relationships with leaders in film making, entertainment and finance. He has managed to keep AMC alive and fighting inspite of shuttered theaters (zero revenue), public fear post pandemic and stock market hell bent on bankrupting AMC. We have survived and turned a corner to profitibility primarily because of Adam's leadership.",256

Can NYSE handle stock prices over $429K?,"For those who don't care for reading the techincal details, you can jump down to **TL;DR Starting Point** at the bottom.

DISCLAIMER: I only started looking into this stuff a few hours ago, so a lot of this is just speculations from reading specification documents with a background in software development. If anyone here knows more about any of this please let me know and I'll make updates as needed. Also, I am not a financial advisor so be sure to do your own research before making any decisions and none of this is financial advise.

UPDATE: It looks like we should be able to use Yahoo Finance as well for ""delayed price"" since it is now working again for BRK-A.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Happy Cinco de Mayo my fellow apes!

This morning like many of you I was reading the [morning post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5cryg/ama_day_wednesday_superstonk_daily_dd_05052021/) from r/Superstonk's mod team, but I got a bit concerned when I came across the news about BRK-A breaking NASDAQ due to its price going over their upper bound of $429,496.7295. As a software developer that number stood out to me because it looked exactly like the upper bound of unsigned 32-bit integers, **4294967295**, but offsetting the decimal place 4 digits over.

After some further reading others mentioned that this is may not be a concern for us since this issue affects NASDAQ but GME is instead traded over the NYSE. However, after reading that I didn't like ""hoping"" that NYSE was in a better place than NASDAQ for us since last I checked the floor has been far above $420K for quite a few months now. So, let's do some digging!

First off, I wanted to figure out what NASDAQ and NYSE were using for their trading protocols since that is where all the live ticker action for stocks will be coming from. A brief look at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_trading_protocols) tells us that NASDAQ are using protocols called [OUCH](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/TradingProducts/OUCH4.2.pdf) and [ITCH](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/dataproducts/NQTVITCHspecification.pdf), and NYSE are using one called [Pillar](https://www.nyse.com/pillar).

My initial findings from Pillar we are bit discouraging, looking at a [document](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse/Pillar_Differences.pdf) that compares it to Arca (what looks to be the predecessor of Pillar?) on the first page it tells us: Current: Max Price supported for order entry is $99,999.99.

Pillar: Max Price supported for order entry is based on the binary u32 limitation in XDP for price: Price scale for individual securities is published in the XDP Symbol Index Mapping Message.

* Max price for securities with a price scale of 6 is $4,294.67296.
* Max price for securities with a price scale of 4 is $429,467.296.
* Any price above these maximums will be rejected.

Which is just a long and roundabout way of saying it has the same limitations as NASDAQ where it the largest price it can handle is $429K, but it says this limitation is only for ""XDP"". I found that ""XDP"" stands for ""Exchange Data Publisher"" and gets explained further in [another document](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Global_Index_Feed_Client_Specification_v1.10.pdf) for Pillar's ""XDP Client specification"". On page 14 it states that they only use 32 bits of data (i.e. 4 bytes) to send over price data and on page 22 explains that it uses the following formula to read the price:

Price = Numerator / (10\^PriceScaleCode)

For those who are not mathematically inclined, this is just a fancy way of saying ""instead of storing 27.56 we store 2756 and tell you to move the decimal point over 2 digits to the left"" where the price scale / scale code is that number that tells you where to put the decimal point.

While this seems to be painting nothing but bad news so far, I was still optimistic and kept plowing further ahead to see if the specification for Pillar as a whole (not just the XDP client specification) looked any better. Looking at the homepage for their website that I linked above, it looks like Pillar has two underlying versions of its protocols: Binary and FIX.

Starting with the Binary version, the [latest specification](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/NYSE_Pillar_Gateway_Binary_Protocol_Specification.pdf) on page 8 outlines that the price data type they use is an ""Unsigned Little Endian 64 Bit with Price Scale of 8"", which is fancy talk for saying the theoretical max price is: **$184,467,440,737.09551615**.

This is certainly an improvement from $429K and tells us that at least in some part of the NYSE they have the capacity to handle prices greater than $429K. Before I dig any deeper into that line of thinking I also wanted to check the FIX version of the protocol.

A brief search tell us that ""FIX"" does not mean it is ""fixing"" anything but is rather an acronym for [Financial Information eXchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange), which is not something specific to NYSE but rather is a specification used by the greater market as a whole. Pulling some snippets from the that wikipedia article, ""According to the FIX Trading Community, FIX has become the de facto messaging standard for pre-trade and trade communication in the global equity markets,"" and, ""FIX is widely used by both the buy side (institutions) as well as the sell side (brokers/dealers) of the financial markets"". So it is very possible this is the version of the protocol that you would see with your broker when you try to make buy/sell stocks.

With that out of the way, looking at the [specifications document](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/NYSE_Pillar_Gateway_FIX_Protocol_Specification.pdf) on page 21 it tells us that the price field they send has a range of values between $0.000001 and **$999,999,999.999999** and is utilized by:

* NYSE
* NYSE American EQ
* NYSE National
* NYSE Arca EQ
* NYSE Chicago

Which is definitely greater than $429K but may crush the hopes of any dreams some of you may have for the price reaching over $1 billion per share (well, the price can get to that point but Pillar cannot handle orders for those price points).

# TL;DR Starting Point

Bringing this all together, it looks like NYSE's Pillar specification (both the binary and FIX versions) can handle prices over $429K currently. The caveats is that the XDP data from Pillar that is used for real-time data can only support up to $429K, but the specification used by the brokerages for buying and selling (which look to be the FIX version) can handle right up to $1 billion per share. So even if real-time data for GME is lost for watching stock tickers you can still go to your broker's site and look at what the bid/ask price is for the stock on their trading page (e.g. right now you can do this for BRK/A on Fidelity to see their price even though real-time data is disabled).

**ELIA**: If GME goes over $429K and stock ticker sites disable real-time data for the stock, you should still see the price from your brokerage on their trading pages and can still sell your shares over $429K.

Why I believe Apple's stock buybacks are misallocation of resources.,"Apple has one of the weirdest financial statements in the stock market, with PBR=45 and PER=30. This means the company‚Äôs yearly profit is greater than the equity it holds. In fact, despite being one of the most profitable company in the world, Apple‚Äôs equity has decreased from $140B (Dec. 2017) to $60B. Why? They‚Äôve spent \~$90B on stock buyback and \~$10B on dividend per year (less before 2022). This is good if you are a short-term owner of the stock as the company is basically an ATM that gives back all of its profit to the shareholders. However, is this good in the long-term? 

They are buying their stock back at PER of 30, which means 3.3% yield. The treasury yield is >4.5% and they are issuing new bonds at >5% ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/apple-tapping-us-high-grade-bond-market-for-debt-in-five-parts?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/apple-tapping-us-high-grade-bond-market-for-debt-in-five-parts?embedded-checkout=true)). So for their stock buyback to make sense, they need to show very good growth over next few years. However, the company has shown negative growth for nearly a year and I see much more obstacles to their growth such as: deglobalization, EU‚Äôs Digital Market Act, saturation of smartphone industry, not much presence in generative AI market. If they do not show significant growth, their resources should have been spent at 1) not rolling over debts at the high rates, 2) acquisitions, 3) R&D, 4) just dividends. 

Because of these reasons, if I have to bet, I would bet their stock buyback will decrease next year. However, Apple has some upsides: low market share in many regions like India, increase in service charges (although this is what DMA seemed to be aimed against), some hidden project like Apple Car. However, I believe Apple‚Äôs main profit-maker (significantly greater margin on Iphone compared to other smartphones) is fully saturated and the company is at a junction where they need to spend their resources at making new revolutionary products and not at stock buybacks.",510
"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024","9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple.",170
AMC STOCK: $300 PRICE TARGET ON DAY X,"AMC stock recently completed an initial technical reaction. Fibonacci retracements of the move from the low on May 6, 2021 to the high on June 2, 2021 show how yesterday's test of the 61.8% Fibo occurred. On Wednesday, short sellers were already targeting this level. The daily low was formed at $33.27, just 5 cents away from the technically magical level. Apparently, it was necessary to join forces in order to make the ultimate breakthrough on the following day. Previously, the neckline of a not quite ideal SKS formation was broken on Tuesday on a closing price basis. 

Contrary to all the prophecies of doom, the undermining of the neckline did not result in a free fall. On the contrary - yesterday's price action even looks encouraging as the 61.8% Fibo withstood the pressure. At the same time, the volume reached its highest level since June 21, while a nice green candle body was formed with only a small wick. By the end of the day, a whopping gain of 7.69% was recorded. 

Today, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) was already up another 5.50% in pre-market trading. Obviously, some of the Apes have kept their word and re-bought so that the trip to the moon doesn't fail due to lack of fuel. Because that's what the Reddit community needs to understand. It's not enough not to sell - because the stocks that are in a portfolio have limited influence on current market events. So if you really want to take the trip to the moon, you need a day X of buying what's possible. Only then will the big players come under such pressure that another short squeeze will cause the price to explode.

In this context, an intriguing question is at what price of AMC stock will the mission be considered accomplished and a lunar base be reached? 

AMC share Fibo Extension
At this point, the Fibonacci extensions help us. The 23.6% and 38.2% extensions are still in double-digit dollars, so they shouldn't matter. A first major milestone can be found with the 50% extension at $104.57, followed by the 100% extension at $136.63, 161.8% at $176.26, 261.8% at $240.39 and 361.8% at $304.52. 

These values, of course, lack any fundamental basis, at least from the current point of view, but that doesn't matter anyway for a meme stock.

I was thinking about price action, and how markets are supposed to match buyers and sellers to find the price of an equity. Now, theoretically let's say 100% of the stock is held at the transfer agent, essentially making the company private and off market. Where does the price discovery happen?

Yes, this is ignoring any price movement leading up to 100% DRS. I'm just theorizing what happens after 100% at whatever price it ends up at.

Please explain how/why I'm wrong because I can't wrap my brain around this. Does this essentially make the stock priceless? Infinity? Or would the valuation of the company itself then determine how much a share would be? Am I just smooth?

Edit: good answers in the comments, turns out I am in fact smooth but things make more sense to me now. And as always, buy hold DRS :)",793

"Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar","* Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month.
* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.  
  
OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.",2436

Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings," Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",1

Michael Burry sold all but one of his stocks last quarter - excluding his Apple puts," **SUMMARY**

* **Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" sold virtually all of his US stocks last quarter.**
* **Burry's Scion Asset Management only held a $3.3 million stake in Geo Group, a new filing shows.**
* **Scion owned $165 million of stocks at the end of March,** ***excluding*** **its Apple put options.**

&#x200B;

 **FULL STORY**

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, slashed his US stock portfolio to a single holding in the second quarter, a [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1649339) revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen. The hedge fund manager [diagnosed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-twitter-return-biggest-market-bubble-ever-2021-6-1030524823?utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=markets&utm_source=markets&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and [warned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6-1030534935?utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=markets&utm_source=markets&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) owners of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

More recently, he has [cautioned investors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-consumer-recession-inflation-stock-market-rally-2022-8?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen [lots of temporary rebounds](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-stock-market-bubble-crash-rallies-2022-5?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) before finding a bottom. He also [warned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-market-silliness-is-back-2022-8?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) the ""silliness"" in markets during the height of the pandemic has returned, and tweeted over the weekend that he ""can't shake that silly pre-Enron, pre-9/11, pre-WorldCom feeling - referring to the euphoria that preceded the dot-com crash.

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

"So, let me get this straight. Based on the GME price manipulation we‚Äôre witnessing and the SHF‚Äôs only play, Gamestop‚Äôs stock price is doomed to be below $30 forever? ü§î‚Ä¶. ü§°","I get that their only hope is to see Gamestop going bankrupt, which, by now, seems extremely unlikely to pretty much impossible.

What I find mind boggling is that based on all this, there are 2 possible outcomes. Or else short positions need to be closed at some point‚Ä¶ and clearly no one on wallstreet, nor the government wants that.., or GME is doomed to remain below $30 until end of times because they (SHFs and their wallstreet friends) armed themselves with rules and laws that allow them to manipulate the price forever without Gamestop being able to fight the leeches off‚Ä¶, which i find absolutely fucked up. 

What are they gonna do when Gamestop‚Äôs cap doubles or triples? Still keep it under $30? What about when the float is fully DRSed and locked? Act like nothing is happening and keep it under $30?

Three reasons why Apples stock price is going to take off this quarter,"1.  The reaction to Q1 earnings was wrong and at some stage sense will return.  The current quarter included 13 weeks instead of the 14 weeks included last year.  Adjusting for this sales rose by 20%, EPS rose by 22% and unit sales increased by 6%.  A level of growth that deserves a higher PE multiple than the current 16.4.

2. The iPhone X was only released on November 3rd meaning it only contributed to sales for 8 weeks and probably delayed purchases prior to that.  The true impact of the iPhone X will become much clearer in Q2 and with significant contribution to revenues and margins.  The iPhone X is the best selling iPhone and has pushed up the average selling price by about $100 to $796.  That momentum has continued through year end and until the end of January and shows no sign of slowing down.  Priced from $999 that by itself will drive margins higher.

3. Finally from Cook's comments on the call, Apple seems to be planning to use about $160 billion of its cash to pay dividends and buyback stock.  At current market cap of $800 billion that represents an incredible 20% of stock outstanding.

Given these three factors alone, I fully believe the EPS forecasts are achievable and that a PE multiple expansion is possible.  However even assuming the PE multiple remains unchanged, the earnings growth alone would increase the SP by 20% from current levels.

GameStop has announced a 4:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. What might this mean for future GME price appreciation?!? A comparative look at Tesla's stock split. Spoiler Alert - This Could Be HUGE!,"TL;DR Part 1:  GameStop has announced a 4:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend.  This means an additional 3 shares for every share held will be issued to shareholders.

* Only a set amount of shares will be distributed to the DTCC for distribution to shareholders.
* Market participants short GME will need to ~~cover~~ close their positions prior to the stock split or they will be responsible for these additional shares.
* More importantly, the naked shorts that all our DD hypothesizes and supports as being hidden through derivative strategies are at risk of exposure and the additional shares from the stock split dividend (additional three shares per short) need to be covered.
* **Taking a look at Tesla's stock split in the form of a stock dividend gives us a sneak peak into what can happen to share price in this type of scenario.  SPOILER ALERT - IT'S HUGE!!**

&#x200B;

# GameStop, GME

GameStop had historic high short interest that dropped dramatically with no stock price appreciation last year.  This is a clear indication of manipulation and hidden short interest:

New put option contracts after the end of January 2021 represented more than 300 percent of shares outstanding, ***more than 200 million shares***.  This massive spike suggests that short positions have been hidden using ‚Äúphantom shares‚Äù and ‚Äústrategic fail-to-delivers.‚Äù  The options scam can be used to reset the clock on fails to deliver.

**Table below: ""Put options open interest spiked to enough contracts to cover 300% of outstanding shares at the exact time that reported Short Interest (SI) decreased and Failures to Deliver (FTDs) decreased"".**

# Tesla Stock Split by way of stock dividend August 2020:

**\*\*\*\*  Note, similar to GameStop, Tesla's short interest declined without share price appreciation the year prior to their stock split. \*\*\*\***

**After the dividend distribution, Tesla's shares squeezed over a period of several months. GME has less outstanding shares, less liquidity, higher borrowing rates, higher margin requirements, and as DD supports - an extensively higher hidden short interest.**

Share price reflected is *after* Tesla's 5:1 stock split price adjustment. **Multiply shares owned by 5 and then watch the price appreciation.**  Zoomed-in to December 2020 - it kept running after this. Tesla share price remained elevated after the squeeze. They have just announced another stock split, to be voted on at their October 2022 AGM.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Part 2:**  Regardless of a short squeeze and MOASS, we have compiled extensive DD supporting why GameStop is a great long term value investment.  However with DRS removing shares from the DTCC, GameStop investors have slowly been removing liquidity and the number shares that can be manipulated.  This tightens the spring for a short squeeze.

Liquidity is tightening, and borrowing costs are high.  Borrowing costs and reported short interest is higher than Tesla at the time of their stock split, and DD supports GME has *extensive* hidden short positions, likely in the hundreds of ~~thousands~~ millions, that are going to be hit hard with this stock split in the form of a stock dividend.

*Opinion:*  It may take some time yet, but with this strategic decision to announce a stock split in the form of a stock dividend, and combining it with the launch of their MarketPlace - GME appears to be positioned for *significant price appreciation over the remainder of this year!!*  \[Note:  As GME truly presents a systemic risk to the markets, be prepared for continued manipulation.  This may still take a while.\]

\[***Edit 07-09 10am EST\]  Perspective:***  GME is at 100% utilization of borrowable shares for 100+ days. Most lenders tend to recall shares to ensure they receive the dividend so that they have the shares to credit to their client accounts.  However borrowers no longer have the ***20+ million shares*** they borrowed to short $GME down.  As borrowers / shorts attempt to buy the shares back to close their short positions, they have a very small pool of liquid shares to buy from - resulting in price appreciation:

Shares outstanding are 76,347,215, less insiders 11.807,433, less DRS 12,700,00 = 51.839,782 free float. Reduced by *less liquid* shares (may not be able to sell in the near term):  Institutional: 13,716,541, Mutual Funds: 7,957,066, ETFs: 6,690,476.  \[Note there is uncertainty about some overlap in Institutional shares and mutual funds and ETFS\].  **This represents a remaining** ***liquid*** **float of only approximately 23,4 million shares for the shorts to buy shares from to close their borrowed** ***and*** **naked/counterfeit/synthetic positions.**

DRS IS WORKING! The price will drop easier as the stock becomes more illiquid! DRS IS WORKING!,"Idk who needs to hear this.

Almost everything the DRS DD has predicted is coming to fruition.

The DD has always said that GME will not moon until the market (and Citadels collateral) crashes.

The point of DRSing is to removed shares from DTC/Cede and co. custodial care.

The DD on DRSing has always said that DRSing will lead to the ‚ôæÔ∏è pool. 

As more shares get removed from DTC/Cede and co custody the stock becomes more illiquid. As that happens **it becomes easier for SHF to drop the price on fewer volume**.

This is all part of the DD. This is the dip before the rip.

Buy. DRS. Hold.

**Edit**

Remind me, when did the DRS campaign really pick up steam?

Summer of 2021, right?

Take a look at this.

It's very possible that Meta will grow for years to come, and the stock will recover, but at this exact moment:

* Facebook has returned 65% over the past 5 years - not bad, but below the 88% for S&P 500, and the  172% for NASDAQ. Despite the fact that holding a single stock is significantly riskier than holding the index
* The price has been cut almost in half from its ATH. 
* It is trading at its lowest P/S and P/E ratios ever. ""The stock is cheap now, the P/E ratio will return to historical levels"" doesn't always work out. 

Again, not to say that Facebook is a bad business or the stock won't recover, but if it was a big part of your position you're probably not doing too well right now. It just highlights that market dominance over decades is exceedingly difficult. There will eventually come a time when Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Google underperform, start stagnating, missing earnings, and decrease in value. If you invest in individual companies you should make sure that you are willing to stomach that risk.",1021

AAPL above 200!!!,"With NVDA in past and me being too poor for NVDA, WWDC 2024 is coming up, there will be lot's of talk of AI. Apple Execs are going to milk the keyword till the last atom. 

1. [Article](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/) shows that with every device getting major OS update, they will be pushing AI with almost anything. Just like Samsung did with Galaxy AI. Basically a selling point of S24 series.
2. With [OpenAI integration with iOS](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-and-openai-are-prepping-a-big-announcement-for-wwdc), possibly with Siri, next launch of iPhone in September will be lit.
3. After every WWDC in June since last 5 year, AAPL gained around 3-5%
4. Basic[ iPad M4 chip is beating chip of Copilot + PC](https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-vs-apple-m4) in all major score. So, with launch or announce of Pro chip for Pro user, all major influencers are gonna jerk off themselves with it.
5. One of AAPL Exec met with TSMC to secure 2nm processors. But that's for next year, not likely to be announced this year.

It's not much like other regards but my entire portfolio is just AAPL Calls.

Underestimating AAPL,"I'm not at surprised at the knee-jerk small sell-off is happening after the Apple Intelligence announcement.  

However, I think Cook et co nailed it.  They are  bringing AI to day to day activities, to the masses.

Apple makes AI capabilities available and  attractive a way that Microsoft, google, and fail to do so as well.   I think it's going to add a lot of Apple over the next couple years, especially as they continue to add features.  Smart to make privacy a priority from the beginning. 

As it will take a while to implement, and apple is under DOJ scrutiny, and people underestimate apple, it'll be a while til it's reflected in share price, but  this implementation I think will pay off long term.  

Until then, some buying opportunities, I'd wager.",291
Are you worried about AAPL long term? ,"Now I‚Äôm not saying to sell all of your Apple stock immediately. However, given that:

1. The Vision Pro was a dud, they‚Äôre pulling back manufacturing/production

2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%

3. Services didn‚Äôt grow as much as we thought they would

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they‚Äôre doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

5. Slow growth in critical markets like China

6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What‚Äôs the next new thing? 

Do I think Apple is doomed? Absolutely not. I love their products, especially the m series MacBooks.

But these points above are a little troubling. TBH I think Microsoft has a brighter future than AAPL. They hold a bigger grip/monopoly on commercial software.

AAPL - buy the dip,"AAPL is about to make a monster comeback üöÄ

Yeah their car and streaming bets flopped, but the Apple bears counting them out are missing one thing - Cupertino is going back to its roots: kicking ass in computers and chips.

Just look at what they did with M1. Apple's silicon plays are insane. You really think they won't leverage that into servers and AI in a massive way?

The narrative is AAPL has lost its mojo. That's exactly when they strike. I've been loading the dip under $175. 

Mark my words:

* $210 by WWDC in June when they flex the new compute/AI roadmap
* $300 within 12 months as the AI server ramp kicks into higher gear

Don't underestimate Apple when they get lean and refocus on the core markets they dominated for decades. A $3T comeback arc is brewing.

Consensus is they are defending, but I suspect they will make a play for the DC dollars.  

Buying every dip.",547
AAPL vent,"I needed a win. I saw AAPL rising in the first 5 min this morning‚Ä¶ seemed unusual, especially for a company with this large of a market cap. 

I queued up a bunch of $197 calls, and hovered my finger over the buy button. I was so close to placing the order. But, I told myself‚Ä¶. ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been here before, and it hasn‚Äôt gone well. You need to wait for the first pullback and subsequent confirmation before buying. You need to be disciplined and follow the rules. After all, we‚Äôre only a couple dollars away from the ATH.‚Äù A simple ABCD set up‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶.. the pullback never came. Then, the stock traded sideways for quite awhile shortly after. ‚ÄúSurely the price will drop any moment, especially since we are literally touching the ATH‚Ä¶ and the stock has tried and failed to break past it twice in the last year. I should hold‚Ä¶.‚Äù Boom‚Ä¶ another run up. This time even higher. Then sideways, then another run up, then sideways. Past the ATH nearly all day. Each time I was sure a massive drop was eminent. So I stayed out until the rise at 1 pm. Pocketed $60 then dipped when I saw the drop happening around 1:20. Came back later to see the price was up another $3. Wtf!? How did I end up only making $60 on a $14/ share increase today?  A play that, had I done what my instincts were telling me to do at 9:35 this morning and clicked the freaking buy button, would have netted me near 10k. This would have been my largest profit by far since starting trading.

So now, I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ ok so do I continue to follow the rules I have set, or what? I break rules and I lose money. I follow rules and I miss out on huge plays. What the actual frig, man.

Anyway, see you all tomorrow. 


EDIT: I wrote this mostly to vent for a sec, and ended up coming off a little dramatic. Didn‚Äôt think it would gain any traction. Yes I have a cash account. No I don‚Äôt have a gambling problem. Yes I will be back tomorrow following my rules. Onward and upward!",199
Here's why AAPL might be a solid buy at ATH,"Thinking about Apple recently, and I'm quite thankful that they haven't released a shitty AI like Google. Not yet, at least.

I think they are a buy right now. The stock has hit the same price ceiling twice in the past year, and is quick approaching it again. Also, WWDC is in 9 days, and a collaboration with OpenAI and Apple is confirmed. 

My expectation is essentially a Siri upgrade, on 4o tech, to be rolled out later this year. I'm bullish on a Siri IQ increase that might inspire me to actually say ""Hey, Siri"" now and then. Might even get a free psychologist.

"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL","I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

TLDR: June $175 calls",415
I SOLD AAPL :(,"I know.  You just buy and forget it.  Yes.  I know.  And yet I am that dumb.  

I had been holding AAPL for long.  Years.  It felt like it has run up too much and is definitely going to reverse from 165.  Sold a call option.  Got called.  Ended up selling the stock.  I was just so convinced that this 28 multiple with 2% revenue growth was going to reverse.  Especially if they increase the price on iphones, how can you justify spending so much when its going to be a recession.  Just felt way overbought.  Every hedge fund is feeling the recession fear in 2023 and wants to hide some place and I think that is what is driving this crazy multiple right now.  Plus the AAPL event coming up in early september.  

And today it got upgraded and 2 bucks away from where it started the year.  

You cant believe the kind of FOMO I am feeling right now to just go and buy it.  But I am resisting.

So, yes, I made that cardinal mistake.  Bring on your, you are so stupid comments.  I deserve it.

But along with it, if you have gone through this, share your experience and suggest a few constructive next steps.  I do want to own AAPL in my portfolio in future.  May be I can do something with this money in mean time, till I find an entry point in AAPL.",841

***Google Survey Update*** GME Ownership W/ $AAPL Control Data (N=501),"# I had every intention of being all done with this very fun project, and then ...

https://preview.redd.it/rrb4emsha9f71.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae9b6972a707e0dc0302cfddb5f1e76cc4f553b3

So some glorious, generous ape (who would like to remain anonymous) went ahead and funded/launched another GCS survey, duplicating my methodology but swapping out $GME for $AAPL.

In other words, we finally have a control, and what is shows is **AMAZING!**

Before we get into the tasty bits, let me start by saying none of this is financial advice. Please do your own due diligence, question everything, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. My personal advice (again, not financial advice, but what I am doing) ... I'm buying shares of $GME, hodling shares of $GME, and shopping at GameStop every chance I get.

If this project is totally new to you, I suggest checking out the two links below.

The first link is my initial Google Consumer Survey post, and it contains tons of information about my methodology, research biases, sample size analysis, etc.

The second link was my most recent (and, I thought, final) post on this project. It also contains what was, at the time, my best guess at how many $GME shares I thought were in circulation in total. Although after seeing these AAPL results, my new guesstimate would be much higher.

Initial research post (with tons and tons of detail): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2cnd4/using\_randomized\_representative\_surveying\_data\_to/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2cnd4/using_randomized_representative_surveying_data_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Most recent update (with N=2,200 results): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdafo/final\_update\_of\_google\_consumer\_survey\_n2200\_at/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdafo/final_update_of_google_consumer_survey_n2200_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

For anyone new and too lazy to be bothered with the above links, here's the skinny (TL;DR) ... I used Google Consumer Surveys to model $GME ownership among a sample of 2,200 U.S. adults using a randomized, representative survey. With these results, I was able to extrapolate ownership across the whole of the U.S. While this isn't a scientific study per se, and it certainly has its shortcomings, I have discovered this to be the best shot we apes have at understanding the minimum number of shares held by retail investors.

# VERY IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

**This research is intentionally designed to provide an underestimation of shares held. This research is not about providing the precise number of shares held, but is instead about establishing a minimum threshold for shares held. The thesis for this project is that U.S. retail investors hold more than the Outstanding shares of $GME, so more than 73MMish shares.**

**Two specific elements of the  research's ensure this is the case:**

**1) Survey response buckets of shares held (see survey links) were intentionally capped at 101 shares ... in other words, if someone responded to the survey and they have 600 shares, 499 of those shares would be completely excluded from these results; only the first 101 of their shares would be counted.**

**2) Coupled households have received a 50% penalty for all shares held ... the reason for this is to ensure shares are never double-counted, which is good, but at the same time this approach completely discounts coupled households where both individuals might hold shares in separate accounts, and it assumes all shares held in coupled households are held jointly.**

**The result: the derived number of shares held is most certainly a fraction of the true number which is okay, because again, the premise of this research was simply to show that U.S. retail owns more than the 73MM outstanding shares of GME.**

So without further ado, here are the updated results with the $AAPL control, as well as links to the actual surveys.

[If I have made any mistakes in the above maths, please let me know. I assure you any errors are not intentional, but I'd definitely welcome the opportunity to correct.](https://preview.redd.it/6bqkw9aka9f71.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e667d7278d0cbe1ce01ed7b207a36d73046406)

# So what does this new $AAPL control data tell us?

Well, for one thing, it clearly demonstrates what a massive underestimation this methodology produces. It's certain U.S. retail investors own way more than 367 million shares of Apple. In other words, this methodology is doing exactly what is was designed to do ... show just the tip of the iceberg.

While I had a very tough time discovering exactly how many shares of Apple U.S. retail investors might own, I can tell you it's a hell of a lot more than 367 million shares. Apple has about 16.5 Billion shares outstanding, and even with 11.7 Billion shares held by institutional investors (per [fintel.io](https://fintel.io)), and another 1.1 Billion shares in ETFs (per [etf.com](https://etf.com)), that still leaves about 3.7 Billion shares. Let's assume only half of these shares reside within U.S. hands, so that's 1.85 Billion. And let's assume half of these are with Insiders, family funds, or small institutions that don't report. So we are left with a paltry 925 million shares of Apple, compared to 16.5 Billion Outstanding. Even after we hack and slash our way here, it looks like this methodology, the very same methodology we used for GameStop, is producing an estimate that is at best only 40% of the actual.

Throughout the comments in my previous posts, people were clamoring for a control. Well, now we have one, and it seems to strongly support what I have thought all along ... hard data (really the only hard data we have) continues to suggest there is an epic buttload of $GME shares way, way beyond the number authorized by GameStop. And not just a few shares, but tens of millions, and likely hundreds of millions.

So remember ... no matter how much they say the squeeze has squoze, no matter how much they tell you the shorts have closed, no matter how many times they tell you you're wrong, it's just like Max Fischer claiming to get a handjob from Dirk Calloway's mom in the back of a Jaguar. It's nothing but ...

"China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+","**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing‚Äôs effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple‚Äôs position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world‚Äôs iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple‚Äôs relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it ‚Äúhas historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,‚Äù KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. ‚ÄúIs the government changing its stance?‚Äù

Why isn't Buffett calling Cook out for buying back AAPL at 27 multiple?,"This is absolutely ridiculous. Apple is burning money by buying back its stock at current prices. Buffett didn't belch when Coca cola did this same shit in the dot com bubble and he later admitted it was the wrong move.

CR-AAPL is a BUY. The AI bull market is only beginning.,"Fiends and family across the globe,

Last week I was beginning to believe we were about to enter a correction. I was mistaken. The markets are instead primed for an ""erection"".

Why? Well, for one I've been watching AAPL quite closely recently. The shadow puppeteers of the market threw out some headlines to pump and dump it this week. AAPL trying to get some AI on their phones with partnerships from Google and chinese companies. AAPL getting sued by Biden admin cuz Trump says he likes to suck off Tim Cook on his CNBC interview. Do these headlines truly affect price though? I doubt it. If there was such concern, their market makers wouldn't have taken the risk to stick AAPL to 172.5 (strike price) over the weekend.

If you follow AAPL closely, you'll notice these guys actually have so much control over their own stock price they regularly burn both sides on earnings. Opex almost always settles at max pain. Not only do they control their stock price, they control the Chinese and American governments. Their stock is a little bit down, but it hasn't diminished their power nor influence. They're still one of the biggest indirect employers in China via their supply lines. In the US they have mind control over about half the population of adult voters and are one of the largest sources of tax revenue.

SO WHY THE FUCK IS AAPL's STOCK DOWN RELATIVE TO THE MARKET!? It's simple. There needs to be an area of intense consolidation for investors to really dial into pushing price higher. Nobody wants to load AAPL at 200 to push for their next step at like 220-230. They want it at 170. That's a much better risk proposition.

NVDA is leading the way and will probably top out at like 5000 or something. Yup, a 13 trillion dollar valuation. The thing is the market just has no chill when it comes to understanding this next wave of economic gains is going to replace most of the workforce by 2030 and businesses won't have to deal with payroll anymore, just taxes. It's gonna be a world just like the Hunger Games, but with a twist of Terminator.  And you're gonna wanna stay long so you're part of the bourgeoisie and not the class of people waiting for bread crumbs wondering what the hell the point of their existence is (to get killed by robots and bio-engineered viruses).",400

AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,"The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.

* Yes, it looks like ski goggles.
* The OS is called **Vision Pro**
* The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:

* If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out

Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).

Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.

Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.

META & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.

Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",664

I expect sales to rise somewhat this year with AI featured iphones but phones are becoming more like PCs with lengthy replacement cycles and less people interested in buying the latest version. Can Apple's appstore and other services revenues would be enough to offset the declining sales year over year? What could the market look like in 5-10 years. 

We are depending on future Apple Vision pro being slimmer and and more affordable but even then unless it's literally rayban glasses sized and it has an interface which is faster than phones, it can never have mass popularity.

AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.  
  
The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.  
  
Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn‚Äôt last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year‚Äôs end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.  
  
And while Apple stock saw the company‚Äôs valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn‚Äôt closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.  
  
Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.

Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?,"If you‚Äôve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it‚Äôs been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple‚Äôs revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Apple‚Äôs earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple‚Äôs revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple‚Äôs rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple‚Äôs AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250‚Äîa potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here‚Äôs the play: Apple‚Äôs trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100‚Äôs 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you‚Äôre looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

Why Warren Buffett is not selling AAPL (anymore) + Some risks for AAPL,"There are some rumors and speculations that Warren Buffett tends to keep selling AAPL due to their recent pullbacks and potential risks faced by the EU, DOJ, and China.

&#x200B;

However, my view is different: Warren Buffett has been an excellent investor and probably, he is the greatest investor of all time with his long lasting track record. 

He is not a 100m sprinter, but a relentless marathon runner. It says his long term strategy.

As his core business is insurance, I am pretty sure that Warren Buffett though about all these potential risks before his decision to invest in AAPL. 

That¬¥s how an insurance company works by analyzing all possible and potential risks (

&#x200B;

The another argument why he is not selling is: He can¬¥t sell (if he would like to..)

**He can't sell because a very high percentage of his capital tied down in Apple consists of embedded capital gains, over 80% at present market prices, meaning that if he sold, the IRS would take a huge chunk of Berkshire's capital in taxes.**

The future will be like Coca Cola or American Express. 

But as I said: He does not want to sell in real, because all potential risks facing now were considered by his own ""due dilligence"" before investing in Apple. 

&#x200B;

And you know: Warren Buffett HATES paying taxes. 

Apple¬¥s narrative is still there. The fundamentals are strong and solid. 

&#x200B;

However, Apple also brings some risks with their recent strategy:

&#x200B;

1. Apple plans to launch ads on TV+
2. Apple plans to launch AI-driven ads on App Store.
3. Not sure what Apple will launch at WWDC.

&#x200B;

Their ad business is critical, because it is a contradiction of what Apple appeals for consumer¬¥s privacy. 

Ad means tracking users. 

&#x200B;

But Apple may lose $20 billion contract which has been paid by Google for their search on iOS if Google loses the antitrust case. 

Apple also needs to allow all developers + consumers to sideload on App Store in the EU. 

&#x200B;

Apple must cover all these potential losses by bringing ads on TV+ and App Store. 

But Apple may face a lot of sensitive consumers and loyal consumers due to a potential privacy issue. 

&#x200B;

It is clear: Apple becomes less attractive than before.

&#x200B;

AI is a ""buzzword"" and how AI will increase the productivity (if the productivity is given, what % increase of the productivity???), nobody knows.

But the market seems to bet on a 100% or 200% productivity increase driven by AI, which may end with a carnage and huge disappointment. 

&#x200B;

But Apple needs to deliver ""WOW""-effects at WWDC. Otherwise, the market will punish Apple again.

Apple needs to come up with fresh new ideas, which have never been introduced by Samsung or Google before. 

At least, Tim Cook calls the upcoming AI event ""incredible breakthrough"".

Where's the guy who swore AAPL puts will print today? Guess we still have a few hours of life support ,"What was the justification behind that? With all the news, and lagging price over last few months behind it's brothers, AAPL was a strong play. I feel bad for that guy, all in today with meetings, announcements, et al. Just because it went up, doesn't mean it's coming right down with that much volume.",784
AAPL,Apple is a great company and I think that it‚Äôs underperformance in 2024 was just unlucky and that 2025-2026 it will thrive and beat the s and p 500 for sure. I have no positions in AAPL I was considering buying in today because of the crazy drop but am scared of it dropping more (I would buy long tearm calls not shares bc I like to lose money) any takes on this stock? Is it at the bottom or should I let next week play out a bit?,8
Is $AAPL able to grow much more?,"I‚Äôm a broke college student but I have enough spare cash to buy one or two shares of Apple while still being able to afford my social life.

However while doing my research I‚Äôve seen a few people suggest that Apple has reached a stage where the share value can‚Äôt increase that much more. 

Many people have said it‚Äôs still a good stock for dividend growth, but as I only intend to buy a couple of shares I‚Äôm not sure if the dividends alone would be enough money to justify me buying. 

It should be noted I‚Äôm intending to hold onto these shares long-term.

**EDIT:** Okay, you guys convinced me. I‚Äôve placed an order for a couple $AAPL shares :)",487

This is what will ACTUALLY happen to TSLA and AAPL on Monday open,"**Bull reasons:**

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.
* Battery day and S&P inclusion for TSLA and ARM based computers from AAPL coming soon.
* If people wanted to lock in gains, they would have done so on Friday.
* StOnKs OnLy gO uP.

&#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.
* All the paper hands see a small initial dip for any of the above reasons and they sell off.

Time to take AAPL gains and GTFO?,"Hi everyone,

Everything Apple has been doing lately has me thinking it's likely to fall soon due to their upcoming security changes. I'm have a relatively small position 10 shares at 127.96. So I won't be making a huge profit but I do think Apple might be a buy in the future when its cheap again. I like Apple products but their security update is seriously having many people globally hesitant to the stance the brand is taking. Is it time to take profits? Thoughts?

&#x200B;

edit: Based on all the comments I decided to hold and will buy more during the next dip as I have no real need for the cash. For those mentioning taxes here in Canada my AAPL stocks are in a TFSA (Tax free savings account) which means gains and withdrawal are non taxable.

Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

_____
The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don‚Äôt get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

‚ÄúIf you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They‚Äôre climbing in the United States. And so there‚Äôs still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs an environment to guide into,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn‚Äôt offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that ‚Äúinitial data points are really quite good.‚Äù

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple‚Äôs iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren‚Äôt counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

‚ÄúA larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that‚Äôs the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we‚Äôre confident we‚Äôll grow in Q1,‚Äù Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple‚Äôs services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",761

Should I Buy AAPL Shares,"Hello, I am currently 19yo and I have a surplus of scholarship money that I was hoping to invest. I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.

Today, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.

EDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \*historically\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump all of the money I have rather than DCAing. Also, very stupid of me to say that Apple owns TSM. But the reason why I don't think it's smart to invest into TSM is because the chip designs are still done by Apple, meaning that Apple is still in control for how well the chips manufactured by TSM and how they perform with  ARM and MacOS software. Hardware performance is dependent on software integration -- the very reason why investing into Apple is more reliable than TSM (though yes both are viable options).",240

AAPL is nearing all time highs - thoughts?,"AAPL is once again touching ATHs and as of writing is trading with a PE just shy of 29.

It's hard to see AAPL moving much higher from here given the valuation and it's also hard to see the market moving much higher without AAPL.

In March AAPL staged a similar recovery almost making new highs before selling off and making new lows.

AAPL is a great company and while I feel it deserves a slight premium to the market I'm struggling to remain bullish given the current valuation. I'm also concerned that AAPL nearing ATHs could once again be signalling peak market bullishness.

I sold half my position on Friday and I'm curious to hear what others are thinking about this stock and the recent bullishness we've seen in the tech stocks generally.",303

AAPL - cashed out,"Despite my belief that Apple's stock (AAPL) will reach $210 as we approach the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), I decided to cash out my position on the recent price surge. Here's my reasoning:

* In the lead-up to WWDC, I expect AAPL to trade more on news and speculation rather than fundamental business factors. For instance, reports of lackluster iPhone shipments in China are likely to disappoint investors again, potentially driving the stock price back down towards $168 or even lower.
* I also anticipate some profit-taking from investors who were waiting for this recent price increase to sell their shares.

While I believe the long-term fundamentals for Apple remain strong, and the stock will move significantly higher over the course of the year, I felt a 4% gain was a good enough opportunity to cash out for now. Investors who maintained a long position have little to worry about, but I think the stock may tread water a bit further before resuming its upward climb. Whether to cash out or stay invested depends on one's risk tolerance and investment time horizon.",39

XLK rebalancing 06/21 NVDA and AAPL,"As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased of NVDA and 11 billion of APPL sold.¬†

Historically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the¬† ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.

For AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity.¬†

As this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1.

"Covered calls are good for getting called away, not so great for income. AAPL example.","Yesterday, I replied to a post (on TTG) where the OP was struggling with what to do on a covered call that had gone in the money. My reply was ""I'm always surprised people don't do Iron Condors in place of covered calls"" which sparked a bit of a discussion. I thought the discussion was worth a longer post and a bigger discussion here.

**Covered calls** are like an entry drug for options. They are extremely straightforward and serve a very useful purpose. That intended purpose looks like this: 1) an investor owns the stock 2) they'd be willing to sell it higher. 3) If they sell OTM calls they have the chance to lower their cost basis before eventually being called away in the stock. 4) IOW, for those wanting to sell stock higher, a covered call strategy is a lot smarter than a GTC sell order in the stock.

Where covered calls get misused (IMHO) is as income generation against long stock. I would argue credit call spreads vs stock are better than covered calls, and I would take it one step further and argue that Iron Condors are better than both. Let me explain.

First, let's start with the **expected move**. You may have seen me talk about the expected move as useful for strike selection. It's also useful for understanding something like a covered call strategy. The way an expected move generally works is that roughly 65-70% of the time the stock finishes at or inside that expected move. The other 30% that goes outside the expected move include some disproportionally big moves. The reasons are aplenty but think blow-out earnings moves, breakouts above resistance, crashes on bad news, etc. That 30% outside the move is much wider than it seems.

So now think about a covered call strategy where the call is at or just above the expected move. The math says it should work 2/3 times before being called away. Maybe even 3/4 depending on delta. The issue is that time it doesn't may be the big move higher. And if your strategy is income, rather than just a smarter way to sell your stock, that move you missed in the stock may be enough to wipe out any income you had collected leading up to that point.

**Iron Condors vs Covered Calls for Income -** Here's a direct comparison of a covered call and a credit Iron Condor using Apple with a May 1st expiration as an example. The Expected Move would put the bullish consensus around $140 (currently trading $130). The 140 call is about 1.80.

*If an investor bought 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) for $130. Then sold 1 May 21st $140 call at $1.80. That lowers their overall cost basis in the stock to $128.20 ($130.00 - $1.80).*

If the stock is at or below $140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.80. An ideal situation is if the stock goes higher, but not higher than $140. However, if the stock goes to $150. They are called away in the stock at 140. If they want to remain long the stock they need to buy to cover the call at a loss, in this example the call would cost at least $10 to close.

As an alternative, a credit Iron Condor is a strategy that looks to collect income by selling both an out-of-the-money credit call spread and an out-of-the-money credit put spread. Traders use credit Iron Condors for several purposes, often outside of stock ownership. The first is simply as a neutral or range trade, looking to receive a credit if a stock stays within a range. A second use is to short volatility, especially farther out in time. Here we'll discuss a third use, as potential income generation for a long stock position. One that does not necessarily cap potential gains in the stock. Here's an example, using the expected move for May 21st ([trade GIF](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/null.2021-04-08-15_24_45.gif)) via Options AI :

*An investor owns 100 shares of Apple, bought for $130. They sell the Apple May 21st 115/120/140/145 Iron Condor at 1.50. This lowers their overall cost basis to $128.50.*

If the stock is between 120 and 140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.50 as added income to stock gains, or as a small buffer vs. losses. Here's how the options position looks on the chart:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/h0u83m1ma8s61.gif

This trade looks to collect 1.50 if the stock is between 120 and 140 on expiration, roughly the same as the 140 call sale that looks to collect 1.80. The difference is if the stock goes through that level, losses from the Iron Condor are capped at 3.50, whereas covering the covered call is undefined. The Condor see its max loss with the stock above $145, however, the long stock would resume gains as it moved above that level.

For example, if the stock is 150, the attempt at income via the Condor would have cost $3.50 vs gains in the stock, with the next $5 in the stock still captured as gains. The attempt at income via the covered call would cost north of $8, wiping out all the gains in the stock above $140.

Or course, the Condor has risk in both directions. If the stock is below $115 on May 21st $3.50 is lost, adding to the losses in the stock. That differs from the covered call where the $1.80 credit is still collected. But if the intent is to be bullish, retain the stock over time, and add income, that occurrence would not be a deal-breaker unless the stock did a long sustained outsized move lower over multiple expirations.

**Summary**

A covered call is often thought of as a bullish strategy. And it is, up to a point. But the investor is capping potential gains in the stock. If the investor is simply looking to add income while holding onto a stock longer term, an Iron Condor could be a more pure expression of that view. Even comparing the Condor to a Credit Call Spread, which would share the ability for gains resuming in the stock w/o the risk of losses on the trade if the stock went lower, the Condor is still a more pure expression of income generation over time, as it is directionally agnostic, and collects more. Edit:  I've turned this post into a longer post with a little more detail over at [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/covered-calls-vs-iron-condors-for-generating-income-on-long-stock-an-example-in-apple-aapl/)

**Update:**

I somewhat cheekily picked a fight with a beloved strategy and that was intentional. My point on a covered call is there‚Äôs a lot more going on than meets the eye. And people miss the effect of lost opportunity cost. Which is real money. That‚Äôs why I used the example of Apple going to to 150. The covered call actually ‚Äúloses‚Äù money versus the condor there. Here‚Äôs a next level way to think about it:

A covered call is .... actually a synthetic short straddle with some leftover stock.

I‚Äôll explain. If I own a 1000 shares of a stock. And sell 10 calls. My resulting position is short 5 calls, short 5 synthetic puts, long 500 shares of stock. If I were to sell 20 calls. I am short a synthetic straddle 10 times with no long stock.

(Short a call and long stock is a synthetic put). Wherever the strike is of the call is the center of the synthetic straddle. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs ‚Äúsomewhat bullish‚Äù if the call it OTM. And is fairly neutral if the call is ATM.

IOW: When a stock gaps higher though a covered call that pain you feel is you covering a short straddle against your stock.",680

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

Is AAPL a good buy right now?,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I¬¥ll try to do that and post it here. That¬¥s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I¬¥ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Apple¬¥s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let¬¥s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple¬¥s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With Apple¬¥s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it¬¥s a little too high. That¬¥s why I don¬¥t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That¬¥s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see Apple¬¥s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That¬¥s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.

**What I¬¥ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That¬¥s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don¬¥t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don¬¥t double in 5 years, I¬¥m rather bullish on this company.

Thank you for reading and I hope I¬¥ll see you again.",206

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

More details soon....

"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",963
"Apple (AAPL.US) continues to increase financial services, and its subsidiaries will provide loans in the future","Technology giant Apple ([AAPL.US](https://AAPL.US)) recently said that a wholly owned subsidiary of the company will use the Apple Pay Later service as the core in the future to verify users' credit and provide short-term loans and other services to its user base.

&#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄApple announced the new lending service at its developer conference (WWDC) on Monday, and the company will compete with similar services offered by Affirm ([AFRM.US](https://AFRM.US)) and PayPal ([PYPL.US](https://PYPL.US)), whose shares fell 5.5 percent by the end of the day after Apple's WWDC announcement of its Apple Pay Later product.

&#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄLater this year, when Apple releases its new iOS 16 iPhone software, users will be able to use Apple Pay to purchase products and pay their balances in four equal installments over a period of up to six weeks through the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service.

&#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt is understood that Apple has entered into a partnership with MasterCard ([MA.US](https://MA.US)), which interacts with suppliers to offer Apple's upcoming Installments white label BNPL products. Apple says Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://GS.US)), the issuer of the Apple Credit Card (Apple Card), is also the technical issuer of these loans and is an official sponsor of BIN, but Apple says it is not using Goldman Sachs' credit decision system or its balance sheet to issue loans this time.

&#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe behind-the-scenes structure of Apple's new loan service, and the fact that the company is handling loan decisions, credit checks and lending for these loans, is indicative of the smart consumer electronics giant's financial services strategy to internalize its financial services framework and infrastructure as much as possible.

&#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄApple is making a full-scale foray into the financial technology (Fintech) industry through its Wallet application and financial services, which are centered on making iPhone products more valuable and useful to users, who will tend to continue to buy Apple hardware - still the company's main source of revenue source.",880

Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.

The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).

Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.

So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",261

Nvidia really just depends on companies wanting and having a need to keep pushing for AI, and even then, I don't know if they can justify being the top company if their revenue is not matching. Personally I have long ITM Microsoft calls and nvidia shares, don't own Apple. What ate your thoughts?

The Biggest Short: Why $AAPL Is An Overvalued Company in Decline,"Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.

While everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple‚Äôs valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.

A lot of people treat Apple like it‚Äôs the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:

>P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  
>  
>P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  
>  
>P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  
>  
>P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  
>  
>D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  
>  
>Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  
>  
>Long term debt: $93B  
>  
>TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  
>  
>TTM Earnings: $59.4B

Currently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:

>P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  
>  
>D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  
>  
>Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  
>  
>Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  
>  
>TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  
>  
>TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)

In their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.

Apple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.

The reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. 

Apple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple‚Äôs revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple‚Äôs revenue and earnings will drop even more.

Everyone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn‚Äôt as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it‚Äôs expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can‚Äôt see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Another product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they‚Äôve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they‚Äôre gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [‚Äúmocked‚Äù](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.

Apple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it‚Äôs hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That‚Äôs a pretty big risk for a company that‚Äôs been bleeding cash.

And finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple‚Äôs main advantages with their software is the fact that they don‚Äôt show ads. When this changes, Apple‚Äôs software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple‚Äôs ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it‚Äôs hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he‚Äôs full of bad takes.

As Apple‚Äôs earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. 

If they don‚Äôt halt or decrease their buyback, they‚Äôll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.

tl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it. This thing is going to come down eventually, the only question is when.",262
GOEV & AAPL TALKS CONFIRMED. DEGENERATES UNITE,"I JUST POSTED ABOUT THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO. DEGENERATES UNITEüöÄüöÄüöÄ. AAPL were in acquisition and partnership talks in 2020, but they fell through. Bullish as hell on this for a couple reasons:

1. If AAPL wants to buy a company out or partner with them for their 1st ever EV project, then you know the company is LEGIT

2. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract w Hyundai (expected in March) and GOEV provides their platform to Hyundai. AAPL just decided to go through Hyundai to get the platform they want... which is GOEVs

In the firm's view, WWDC represents the most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center with Cook & Co. set to make history for Cupertino. Wedbush believes AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring ample monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share to the Cupertino growth story as the vision starts to play out within the golden installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices.

Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company‚Äôs history, and a 22% increase over last year‚Äôs $90 billion authorization.  

Here‚Äôs how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach that overall sales would ‚Äúgrow low single digits‚Äù during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

‚ÄúIf you remove that $5 billion from last year‚Äôs results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúAnd so that‚Äôs how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.‚Äù 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year‚Äôs increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment‚Äôs high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company‚Äôs new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple‚Äôs major product lines.  

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only scratching the surface there so we couldn‚Äôt be more excited about our opportunity there,‚Äù Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has ‚Äúbig plans to announce‚Äù from an ‚ÄúAI point of view‚Äù during its iPad event next week as well as at the company‚Äôs annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That‚Äôs how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple‚Äôs App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple‚Äôs third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

‚ÄúI feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,‚Äù Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. ‚ÄúThat may come as a surprise to some people,‚Äù Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple‚Äôs $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple‚Äôs previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.  
  
OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.",2435

Are Apple Shares Halal? - Conflicting Information Found!,"Hey everyone,

I've been delving into the world of Islamic finance recently, and one question that's been on my mind is whether investing in Apple shares aligns with Islamic principles. I came across some conflicting information, and I'm hoping to get some clarity from this community.

I've read in some sources that Apple shares (AAPL) are not considered halal due to the company's involvement in interest-based transactions or non-compliant revenue streams. However, I've also stumbled upon the Invesco Dow Jones Islamic Global Developed Markets UCITS ETF Acc (ticker: IGDA), which includes Apple among its holdings.

Considering this ETF is specifically designed to comply with Islamic finance principles and includes Apple shares, does that mean Apple shares are indeed halal? Or is there something I'm missing here?

I'd greatly appreciate any insights or resources you could share to help me understand this better. Thank you in advance for your help!",4

Moomoo‚Äôs Platform Free Apple Share,"Genuinely curious, why would they do this? (If anyone familiar with the Fintech field with insight can share your PoV)

It almost sounds too good to be true (tbh I still haven‚Äôt gotten my free Apple share so far, still counting down). One of my friends speculated that they want to get users to sign up and tempted to trade with the deposited cash. But then realistically, we can just sit back, wait for the free Apple share, sell, withdraw everything. 

For the uninitiated (since I can‚Äôt post image here): if you sign up for a Moomoo trading account and maintain an asset of MYR 8k for 30days, they give you a free Apple share. You heard that right, you just have to deposit 8k and sit back for a month to earn nearly 10% return.

That‚Äôs still way more lucrative promo than any any trading platform did when launching in Msia. Back when StashAway was introduced, they offered free 6months management cost, and Rakuten with their free points (which is near worthless tbh). A free apple share worth nearly rm800 after conversion is just way too much? It‚Äôs an overkill even for marketing purpose?

I am an apple fanboy and I think I should own the company and not some random dudes who own apple's shares. ,"I am totally furious about the fact that some random shareholders and their board of directors control apple's policies, their decision making, prices of their products. It's just so frustrating to see that other companies like Aramco are owned by their fanboys but the biggest fanboy company is not owned by fanboys like me. You can totally see the disadvantages of fanboys not owning the company. They literally copy pasted the same iPhone with minor tweaks to avoid plagiarism for the past 16 years and stole the concept of VR headset from Meta and are selling it for a stupid price. If fanboys actually owned Apple, we'd have come up with a revolutionary design and concept for new devices each year just like how Steve Jobs did. It's the only possible solution, apple's shareholders and their board of directors must leave the company for fanboys like me to take over the company. That's the only way moving forward the company can survive and surely in the future all companies will be owned by their fanboys only.

Today I received a mysterious Fedex package with one share of Apple stock from 2004. Wondering how to proceed.,"When I got home from work today I had a package from FedEx. Inside the package was a certificate for 1 share of common stock from Apple Computer, Inc. dated 2004. Stapled to the certificate is a letter from National Financial Services LLC.  The letter reads,

 ‚Äú Dear Customer, National Financial Services LLC has received and reviewed your deposit request; however, we are unable to complete this request for the reason(s) stated on the reverse side of this letter. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a customer service representative.‚Äù

On the back of the letter there is a check mark on a box that says, ‚ÄúCertificate(s) have been escheated to the state.‚Äù  It also gives me a number to call which I plan to do tomorrow during business hours. 

I am not sure that this stock was meant for me. On the back of the stock certificate there is a box for the social security number of the assignee.  This SSN does not match mine. 

I‚Äôm assuming someone would do their due diligence before sending this to me?  Think it is meant for me?

Any chance this is a scam? Any chance this WAS actually meant for me? Any advice on how to proceed?

Thanks.

Edit: consensus seems to be that this is a scam. That was my first instinct. Thanks for all of the replies. 

Update: I called Fidelity (they manage my 401k and IRA). The guy I spoke with confirmed that they had no record of sending me anything. He also told me that the primary mailing address for them is in Cincinnati OH. The package was mailed from Jersey City NJ. He said it‚Äôs safe to throw it out.

Update 2: I called Apple Investor Relations (computershare). They verified that the certificate number was valid and that it was associated with my name. They also verified it had been escheated by a state but would not tell me which one. They did confirm that is wasn‚Äôt one that I live(d) in. I went to missingmoney.com and there are two properties with my name (over $100) with Apple Inc as the reporting business. I emailed the treasury for that state asking for some clarification. I‚Äôm now so confused‚Ä¶",1676

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13%,"Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the ‚ÄúOracle of Omaha‚Äù continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.

In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire‚Äôs biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.

This is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple‚Äôs stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.

The Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire‚Äôs cluster of insurers.

Many has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple‚Äôs stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire‚Äôs equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.

Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.

It‚Äôs not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was ‚Äúprobably a mistake.‚Äù Also it‚Äôs not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.

Even with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple‚Äôs largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.

Apple should create its own ‚Äúlogin with Facebook/google‚Äù tool for websites and NOT share the data.,"I‚Äôve been reading [Zucked](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525561358/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_-x6UCbTFR0YFX) about how terrible Facebook is with data privacy and security. One of the ways they (and google) harvest data is by giving people the ability to login to websites using their f/g account. Those websites do this to harvest more data for their nefarious purposes. ([don‚Äôt do this, btw](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/technology/personaltech/facebook-log-in-hack.html))

This seems like an opportunity for Apple to create a relatively simple tool that could serve the same function but not collect the data. It would be a great shot across the bow  to these companies, and providing a service without the downsides. I think It would make people more trusting of Apple.

The economics of Apple share repurchase,"That is the topic of [my latest Bloomberg column](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-09/apple-ipad-shows-big-tech-is-productive-even-as-influence-wanes?sref=htOHjx5Y), and here is the basic setting:

Apple unveiled a¬†[record stock buyback plan](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-02/apple-s-110-billion-stock-buyback-plan-is-largest-in-us-history?sref=EP6bV7CS)¬†last week even as it¬†[increased its dividend](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-02/apple-sales-decline-less-than-feared-as-company-plots-comeback?sref=EP6bV7CS)¬†by 4%, to 25 cents per share. That made the market happy, and shares in the company are up about 10% since the announcement.

And this:

Given that the market approved of Apple sending more money outside the company, the market must think Apple shareholders are better at allocating funds than Apple is. Apple, to its credit, has realized this. Of course Apple still has plenty of cash on hand and some very strong market positions, most of all for its iPhones. So it‚Äôs not quite a case of the market telling Apple management it doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs doing. Instead, the market is seeing that Apple is wise enough to rethink its most marginal plans. That is bullish for the overall value of Apple.

There is another aspect to this story that suggests a relatively bright future for Apple. By buying back shares, Apple management is signaling that those shares are underpriced. That means the company is relatively optimistic about the plans it already has underway, as it is willing to hold an extra concentration of equity in those plans. It is not trying to pawn off those returns on unsuspecting others, as a dishonest company might do if the whole enterprise were rotten. The market is rewarding this refreshing sign of honesty.

So the signaled skepticism about new, marginal plans for the most doubtful projects is combined with optimism about existing, presumably promising infra-marginal plans, to use economic terminology. No, Apple is saying, we cannot take over the world, but what we have in the works will go well. And the market believes it.

If you are worried about Big Tech taking over the world but want your favorite products to keep improving, all this is pretty positive news. It is a sign that Big Tech‚Äôs influence has peaked ‚Äî but that its core products will remain popular and likely will get better.

I remain happy with my iPad Pro, but I am not sure how much better it is going to get.

PSA: Apple Card Family Sharing caused rapid battery drain on family's iPhones and Apple Watches,"I had an Apple Card for a year without issues. Then started noticing iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 5 batteries dying oddly quickly. Watch was extreme, it went from two days on a charge to 4-5 hours tops. My spouse noticed same with iPhone 11 and watch. Then our son with iPhone 11 Pro and watch.

Researching, I found posts blaming Family Sharing. The timing fit when we went to family sharing and starting having issues. So I contacted Apple support for help. They assured me that wasn‚Äôt it.

Reset both to factory defaults. No joy. Reluctantly paid for new iPhone battery (max 87% and I am looking to keep it a while longer). No change.

Canceled our son‚Äôs card and he said it helped noticeably. Told support. Still assured it wasn‚Äôt it. They kept trying other things and talking about turning off background app refresh - no, I'm not giving up features just close this case. Frustrated, I finally canceled both remaining Apple Cards.

Problem solved. It‚Äôs been a month with no issues for the three of us. My son signed up for his own card and it is working fine. My other son always had his own card and never had any of these issues.",722

New DFV Tweet Speculation,"Back in April, DFV tweeted [a picture of ""Boy With Apple"".](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1379886701099814915?s=20) The next day, GameStop announced Ryan Cohen to be chairman.

Today DFV tweets an edited picture of [""The Son of Man""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man) with Ryan Cohen edited in as the man, and the link between the two portraits, the green apple, now changed to the GameStop logo. 

All speculation is mine alone, but it was reported that Ryan Cohen had 6.2 million split-adjusted apple shares as of August 31, 2020. Could this be a sign that perhaps Ryan Cohen will be swapping out his shares of apple and going all in on GME with the help of those funds? As of market close his apple shares alone will equate to about 3.5 million GME shares.",3453

"If Apple lost 50% of its share price tomorrow, on no news, just because of short sellers, would you buy more or sell?","The share price means nothing to GameStop, the company, unless it is in dire financial conditions and needs to dilute to raise money. This is not the case with GameStop.

The share price being low is good news to an investor, who can buy more of the company at a lower price.

The company is in a better position now and on the verge of full year profitability than it was a year or two ago, when the price was higher.

Investors just need to wait and watch their company transform, the short and distort tactics mean nothing if you just wait until your thesis plays out.

There is a bottom, lest the price show the company is intrinsically undervalued, at which point everyone buys.

Whenever you see this, just imagine it is happening to a company like Apple or Microsoft. If short sellers were stupid enough to naked short Apple down to $10, you think everyone would be buying or selling?

Seen this before with BitCoyn, seen it before with Tesla. Just wait until they can go long themselves and you'll see true price discovery. But that only happens when they convince you to sell to them, and they would ideally like to buy at the bottom, hence the price.",1482

"China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+","**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing‚Äôs effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple‚Äôs position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world‚Äôs iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple‚Äôs relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it ‚Äúhas historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,‚Äù KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. ‚ÄúIs the government changing its stance?‚Äù

AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.  
  
The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.  
  
Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn‚Äôt last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year‚Äôs end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.  
  
And while Apple stock saw the company‚Äôs valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn‚Äôt closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.  
  
Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.  
  
In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Edit: Thanks everyone for responding.

It also seems that for the first and last 10 minutes of the market open/close, it is 10% threshold. 

This definitely helped clarify things for me, and would explain why it didn't halt this morning, but I still don't understand why it was halting on Friday with less movement.",4184

_____
The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don‚Äôt get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

‚ÄúIf you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They‚Äôre climbing in the United States. And so there‚Äôs still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs an environment to guide into,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn‚Äôt offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that ‚Äúinitial data points are really quite good.‚Äù

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple‚Äôs iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren‚Äôt counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

‚ÄúA larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that‚Äôs the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we‚Äôre confident we‚Äôll grow in Q1,‚Äù Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple‚Äôs services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",757

HIMS company stock drops after CEO applauds & offers employment to protesters,"After Andrew Dudum, CEO of the hair loss treatment company Hims & Hers tweeted on May 1st applauding the ‚Äúmoral courage‚Äù of the Pro-Palestine protesters, his company‚Äôs stock dropped drastically. Opening on May 3rd at $12.24, the stock price dropped a total of 8% ending the day at $11.26.

The CEO‚Äôs tweet stated ‚ÄúMoral Courage > College degrees‚Äù among other things encouraging protesters. He then went to end the tweet with a link to his company, telling the pro-Palestinian audience to apply. Leaving a message that protesters are hirable ‚Äúregardless of university discipline.‚Äù

This situation highlights the consequences of Free Speech on business owners and investors.
Even free speech that is against what many call a genocide.

In response to this, many TikTokers in support of Palestine have created videos accentuating this event and calling for the support of the company; amassing hundreds of thousands of views & comments claiming to purchase stocks in $HIMS.

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",968
What stocks are the most damaging to humanity?  I‚Äôm going to buy one to ensure the price drops!,"Like clockwork, whatever stock I buy goes down immediately.  Whenever I buy calls, the stock plummets.  If I buy puts, the stock skyrockets.  And if I buy near money calls and puts, the stock trades sideways eating me up.  I‚Äôm single handily responsible for stopping TSLA‚Äôs recent spike having bought short term calls and I‚Äôm responsible for AAPL‚Äôs recent spike over 200, having bought puts.  I held the movie theater stock (can‚Äôt name it in this subreddit) for years and sold it.  Same day, it spiked 50%.  Within an hour.  Literally.  I held 5000 shares of a meme stock that I‚Äôm not allowed to name in this subreddit  at 5 in early 2020.  But I sold for a breakeven.  Within weeks, boooyaaa, trading in the 100s.  I went big on the merger news for spirit thinking there would be no chance in hell a competent DOJ could argue with a straight face that a combined JetBlue and spirit only being the 5th biggest airline was anticompetitive, especially considering we would finally have a competitor to the big 4.  And even if the Biden DOJ was to pursue such a claim to the end, no way a judge would agree that the 5th biggest airline would be too big.  What I failed to consider, however, was my bad luck.  I bought in and it‚Äôs because of me the merger wasn‚Äôt approved.  Lost 75% of my IRA.

Nevertheless, I‚Äôve decided to use bad luck for good.  I have $50,000 I want to drop into a company that‚Äôs bad for humanity to bring its shares down.  Whether it‚Äôs pollution of the earth (oil companies), pollution of the mind (social media companies), evil CEOs (Microsoft or Facebook), or evil companies that put profit over safety, I need suggestions.  Please give me some, I guarantee I will bring down the one I choose.

Warning:  if I think about buying a stock and don‚Äôt buy it, it goes up.  So for those of you who give me good suggestions that I don‚Äôt buy, those stocks have a chance of running to the moon.

So what stocks do u want me to target?

$AAPL buys back $80B in stock for trailing-twelve-months,"[Apple bought back $80B of stock last year](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/stock_buyback)

Are we supposed to just ignore how much value Apple is returning to shareholders? 

This is why I almost think you can‚Äôt go wrong with $AAPL 2023 calls. Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. 

For those apes that are new and don‚Äôt understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then ‚Äúburn‚Äù them into thin air. 

What are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs.

The stock market should NOT bottom until $AAPL is $60,"Apple makes up almost 6% of the S&P 500 and despite the rough year for all you bag holders and virgin fund bogleheads...$AAPL is still trading at nosebleed levels.

Sure, all the meme stocks are crushed and down 90%. But there hasn't been bull capitulation yet and when stocks like $AAPL are barely getting a haircut...that doesn't mean Apple is amazing... because they're not. It means the market has a lot lower to go. 

Rates are NOT going down in 2023 so you can kiss the secular bull market goodbye. The risk free rate is increasing and whether or not we have a recession is irrelevant because inflation is still above the target of 2%. A recession will be good for inflation but it won't necessitate rate cuts. 

Why do I hate Apple? They have 16 BILLION shares outstanding and it's still trading with a market cap of 2T...this is categorically ABSURD.

The ONLY reason why $AAPL has been trading higher is the same reason why $TSLA is still insanely overvalued...a lot of stupid people are buying and holding it...just because.

You can't justify Apple's valuation here any more than the bulls could justify $SPY at $480 in January 2022.

I'll stop being a üåàüêª when Apple falls back down to earth. Until then, I'd recommend tactical asset allocation and opportunistic gambling...but Bogleheads will get rekt again in 2023.

Finally dropped my AAPL bags... Never Buying Stocks Again.,"So I finally got the chance to sell my AAPL shares without a loss. I bought them back on Sept 2nd, 2020 for $135.

I did not dollar cost average... AND WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!

About two hours after I bought, AAPL crashed approximately 12%. A week later I was down about 25% and in the intervening 10 months since then has only broke above my cost basis once or twice for a day or two. Other than than it's been stuck between $115-125 for 10 months. It's been miserable.

If I had only DCA it wouldn't have been so bad. In fact, it would have turned out nicely. So I will never do lump sum again. I will always DCA and I don't care if I miss out on some upside since there is no guarantee of that either.

If I had only bought SPY or VTI I would have made out nicely... even if I didn't DCA.

Also important to note, since I bought on that day, my entire outlook on AAPL has changed. Yes, it's a great company that makes great products that everyone loves, myself included. But that doens't necessarily mean it's a good investment or that it isn't overvalued at any given point in time. It is a 2 trillion dollar company. How much larger can it get realistically?

So many people say ""buy great companies"" and you'll do well. Yes, but you're at their mercy at that point whatever the outcome. At least with indexing you get all the winners, even though you get the losers too.

So lesson here is to stick to the Boglehead strategy and don't listen to online advice no matter how great an individual company is. When yo invest in just one company, or even a few, you're beholden to them.

"Facebook scrambles to escape stock‚Äôs death spiral as users flee, sales drop","A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.

Today the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.

Facebook‚Äôs business was built on network effects ‚Äî users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company‚Äôs ensuing profits ‚Äî and they were plentiful ‚Äî provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook‚Äôs once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company‚Äôs future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg¬†[said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse ‚Äúwill reach a billion people‚Äù and ‚Äúhost hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.‚Äù He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html)¬†CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer in June that the ‚ÄúNorth Star‚Äù is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a ‚Äúmassive economy‚Äù around digital goods.

Investors aren‚Äôt enthusiastic about it, and the way they‚Äôre dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can‚Äôt recover.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a core business that works anymore at Facebook,‚Äù said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it‚Äôs no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that‚Äôs the only thing it‚Äôs known. The company‚Äôs slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I‚Äôm just worried that they‚Äôre not winning the next generation,‚Äù said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok‚Äôs success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users‚Äô Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely ‚Äúget tremendous revenue flow from that‚Äù algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it‚Äôs early days for monetizing Reels, and it‚Äôs not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok‚Äôs business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China‚Äôs ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who‚Äôs [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very promising,‚Äù Sandberg said, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôve got some hard work ahead of us.‚Äù

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn‚Äôt strong enough to stand alone,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúHe must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.‚Äù

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook‚Äôs ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple‚Äôs changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn‚Äôt solvable with AI.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,‚Äù said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. ‚ÄúSocial networks are switchable, right?‚Äù

When you look at Meta‚Äôs user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is ‚Äúnot in a good position.‚Äù

## ‚ÄòForce for good or evil‚Äô

The last time Facebook‚Äôs market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including ‚ÄúWhat Great Brands Do‚Äù and ‚ÄúFusion,‚Äù said there‚Äôs little evidence to suggest that Facebook‚Äôs rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

‚ÄúI think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,‚Äù Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino‚Äôs Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company‚Äôs kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino‚Äôs launched a marketing blitz called the [‚ÄúPizza Turnaround.‚Äù](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company‚Äôs approach was, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been told our pizzas suck, and so we‚Äôre actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people‚Äôs perceptions.‚Äù While it sounded initially like ‚Äújust marketing speak,‚Äù Yohn said, ‚Äúthey actually really did change.‚Äù

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not ‚Äúcoming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he‚Äôs envisioning,‚Äù she said.

Meta‚Äôs reputational hit could also harm the company‚Äôs ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it‚Äôs viewed as having less ‚Äúmoral downside.‚Äù

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he‚Äôs seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are ‚Äúhaving to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.‚Äù

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company‚Äôs ability to move ‚Äúfrom the PC to the mobile world.‚Äù Facebook‚Äôs mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg‚Äôs success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

‚ÄúI think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,‚Äù said Dollarhide. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn‚Äôt bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).‚Äù

Dollarhide‚Äôs firm hasn‚Äôt owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

‚ÄúThe reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,‚Äù Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he‚Äôs banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there‚Äôs immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse‚Äôs prospects.

‚ÄúThe real question is ‚Äî are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?‚Äù Zhao said. ‚ÄúIs the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That‚Äôs a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.‚Äù

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta‚Äôs stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron‚Äôs](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined ‚ÄúFacebook is worth $15‚Äù with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

Did Gamestop have an announcement aswell? Or why did GME drop at the same second another stock dropped. Ask yourself why.,"Hey, 
Another stock had an announcement today and after it, the stock dropped 25%. At the same second GME dropped aswell, not 25% but 3%. For every drop / raise there must be a reason right? So why did GME drop today? Did the company issue an announcement aswell? What was the reason?

"SEC sues Coinbase over exchange and staking programs, stock drops 15% premarket","> The Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Coinbase
 in New York federal court on Tuesday morning, alleging that the company was acting as an unregistered broker and exchange and demanding that the company be ‚Äúpermanently restrained and enjoined‚Äù from continuing to do so.

> Shares fell 15% in premarket trading Tuesday. Coinbase stock had already fallen 9% on Monday, after the SEC unveiled charges against rival crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao.

> Coinbase‚Äôs flagship prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws, the regulator alleged in its complaint. The company ‚Äúhas for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements‚Äù of U.S. securities law.

> The SEC has alleged that at least 13 crypto assets available to Coinbase customers were considered ‚Äúcrypto asset securities‚Äù by the regulator. Those assets include Solana‚Äôs SOL token, Cardano‚Äôs token and Protocol Labs‚Äô Filecoin token.

> ‚ÄúWe allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,‚Äù said SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.

> Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DRS IS WORKING! The price will drop easier as the stock becomes more illiquid! DRS IS WORKING!,"Idk who needs to hear this.

Almost everything the DRS DD has predicted is coming to fruition.

The DD has always said that GME will not moon until the market (and Citadels collateral) crashes.

The point of DRSing is to removed shares from DTC/Cede and co. custodial care.

The DD on DRSing has always said that DRSing will lead to the ‚ôæÔ∏è pool. 

As more shares get removed from DTC/Cede and co custody the stock becomes more illiquid. As that happens **it becomes easier for SHF to drop the price on fewer volume**.

This is all part of the DD. This is the dip before the rip.

Buy. DRS. Hold.

**Edit**

Remind me, when did the DRS campaign really pick up steam?

Summer of 2021, right?

Take a look at this.

www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t629e1/today_was_9th_lowest_volume_in_the_last_5_years

You see that?

**All 10 of the lowest volume days in the past 5 years of GME trading have happened in the past 7 months**.(summer of 2021)

DRS is working. Stock is drying up.

"let's be real. if a megacap stock drops 50%, 99% of y'all wouldn't touch it","It's intriguing how recent market trends, like META's dramatic drop and subsequent recovery, reflect investor psychology more than rational analysis. Earlier this year, META was trading at a 75% discount from its all-time high, and the general sentiment was overwhelmingly negative, akin to buying Blockbuster stock in 2006.

However, following its near 300% rise from that low point, perceptions have shifted drastically. This flip-flop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing: market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. If META, or any big name for that matter, dropped by 50% again, history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away, not jump in.

This pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market, where fear and greed often override logical decision-making. It's why individual stock picking, especially based on market dips, can be so risky and unpredictable. It demonstrates the value of a more diversified, steady approach, like investing in index funds, which is likely a more suitable strategy for the majority of investors.",923

Warner Bros. Discovery Stock Drops After Max Presentation.,,613
6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock,"**tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.

It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.

AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?

Here are my 6 reasons:

* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.
* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic
* **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.
* **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic**, which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.
* **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.
* **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...",59

Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I¬¥ll try to do that and post it here. That¬¥s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I¬¥ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple¬¥s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let¬¥s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple¬¥s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple¬¥s price is higher right now, I don¬¥t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That¬¥s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple¬¥s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I¬¥ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That¬¥s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don¬¥t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I¬¥ll see you again.",55

Why should a war in Ukraine cause significant drops in the US stock market?,"The top market cap companies in the S&P500 are companies like FAAMNG. None of their business has anything to do with what's going on in Ukraine. Of course it's possible, that a war would cause energy prices to rise even higher, which could indirectly cause people to buy less iPhones or stuff on Amazon, but besides those very indirect effects, it appears that the vast majority of American companies are not affected whatsoever with what's going on over there.",1615

[Click Here to Dive In](https://stockinvest.us/stock/AAPL?sref=reddit) üåü

**Technical Analysis**



Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) closed at $186.88 on May 23, 2024, representing a drop of 2.11% or $4.02 from the previous trading day. The stock's trading range for the day was between $186.63 and $191. Over the last year, AAPL's price has oscillated between a low of $164.08 and a high of $199.62. Current technical indicators show the RSI14 at 58, slightly below the overbought threshold, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. 



The 50-day moving average of $175.58 and the 200-day moving average of $180.92 indicate continued bullish momentum, with the shorter-term moving average remaining above the long-term one. The MACD of 7.47 supports the bullish stance. However, with an ATR of 1.75, AAPL displays moderate volatility. 



Today's support and resistance levels are $183.38 and $187.43, respectively, hinting at a slight downside risk but also potential stabilization around current levels. 



**Fundamental Analysis**



Apple Inc.'s market capitalization stands at $2.92 trillion, making it the largest publicly traded company by market value. The stock has a P/E ratio of 29.6, which is relatively high but can be justified given Apple‚Äôs historical performance and growth potential. The company‚Äôs EPS of $6.43 shows solid profitability. 



Analyst sentiment is leaning positive, with Wedbush recently raising the price target to $275 from $250 on expectations of an AI-driven ""iPhone 16 supercycle"" and stabilization in iPhone demand. Out of 36 analysts, 25 rate it as a 'Buy', 9 as 'Hold', and 2 as 'Sell'. This consensus indicates broad optimism about Apple's future performance. 



The company's earnings announcement scheduled for August 1, 2024, will be a key driver of short-term stock price movement. The intrinsic value as per Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is approximately $133.94, significantly lower than the current market price, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. 



**Upcoming Predictions**



For the next trading day, May 24, 2024, the stock may experience moderate volatility given recent bullish sentiments, especially in light of favorable analyst updates and increasing interest in AI opportunities. The support around $183.38 could be critical to watch if bearish trends continue, while resistance at $187.43 is likely pivotal for any short-term rebound. 



Over the coming week, positive news pertaining to AI developments and stabilization in iPhone demand could drive AAPL's stock higher, potentially testing the upper resistance levels around its yearly high. 



**Intrinsic Value and Long-Term Investment Potential**



The current DCF value of $133.94 suggests the stock is trading above its intrinsic value, indicating a potential overvaluation. However, for long-term investors, Apple's robust fundamentals, innovation pipeline, and market leadership position offer substantial growth opportunities. The company's forward guidance, particularly regarding AI and China market recovery, supports a bullish long-term outlook. 



**Overall Evaluation: Hold**



Despite the recent price dip, Apple's strong market position and positive analyst outlooks suggest i [...]

"Losses of Apple, Amazon and Facebook bring down stock market"," 

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

Traders are looking to find an appropriate valuation for technology stocks and assess the health of the US economy as the coronavirus pandemic progresses after killing more than 180,000 Americans.

While the tech industry is generating huge profits during lockdowns, there is also evidence that high-profile companies are overbought.

Elsewhere, emerging market stocks fell for the third day. European stocks plunged. Asian stocks fell, with the Australian index registering the biggest drop since May. Meanwhile, the Ibovespa faced declines of more than 3%, and risks losing 100,000 points again.

I was wondering what is going on in Apple stock since 2023 in comparison to the other ‚ÄöMagnificent 7‚Äò - yes we didn‚Äòt have any major breakthroughs to push revenue significantly higher - but the question i was asking myself: is this intentionally or is Apple REALLY out of ideas (i don‚Äòt think so).

In regards to the DOJ Lawsuit, it wouldn‚Äòt be a stupid strategic move to push the stock price lower to change the view on Apple. Wouldn‚Äòt it be more likely that the DOJ say ‚ÄûApple is a anticompetitive Monopoly‚Äú, when the stockprice would have outperformed the other Mag.7 & Apple is by far the most valuable company?
Now Apples move is to dive into cloudy water to mix up with the other average-performing ‚Äûfishes‚Äú, to offset the view on their business & valuation.

What stocks are the most damaging to humanity?  I‚Äôm going to buy one to ensure the price drops!,"Like clockwork, whatever stock I buy goes down immediately.  Whenever I buy calls, the stock plummets.  If I buy puts, the stock skyrockets.  And if I buy near money calls and puts, the stock trades sideways eating me up.  I‚Äôm single handily responsible for stopping TSLA‚Äôs recent spike having bought short term calls and I‚Äôm responsible for AAPL‚Äôs recent spike over 200, having bought puts.  I held the movie theater stock (can‚Äôt name it in this subreddit) for years and sold it.  Same day, it spiked 50%.  Within an hour.  Literally.  I held 5000 shares of a meme stock that I‚Äôm not allowed to name in this subreddit  at 5 in early 2020.  But I sold for a breakeven.  Within weeks, boooyaaa, trading in the 100s.  I went big on the merger news for spirit thinking there would be no chance in hell a competent DOJ could argue with a straight face that a combined JetBlue and spirit only being the 5th biggest airline was anticompetitive, especially considering we would finally have a competitor to the big 4.  And even if the Biden DOJ was to pursue such a claim to the end, no way a judge would agree that the 5th biggest airline would be too big.  What I failed to consider, however, was my bad luck.  I bought in and it‚Äôs because of me the merger wasn‚Äôt approved.  Lost 75% of my IRA.

Nevertheless, I‚Äôve decided to use bad luck for good.  I have $50,000 I want to drop into a company that‚Äôs bad for humanity to bring its shares down.  Whether it‚Äôs pollution of the earth (oil companies), pollution of the mind (social media companies), evil CEOs (Microsoft or Facebook), or evil companies that put profit over safety, I need suggestions.  Please give me some, I guarantee I will bring down the one I choose.

Warning:  if I think about buying a stock and don‚Äôt buy it, it goes up.  So for those of you who give me good suggestions that I don‚Äôt buy, those stocks have a chance of running to the moon.

So what stocks do u want me to target?

Apple stock goes straight down after announcing VR,,1
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13%,"Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the ‚ÄúOracle of Omaha‚Äù continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.

In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire‚Äôs biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.

This is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple‚Äôs stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.

The Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire‚Äôs cluster of insurers.

Many has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple‚Äôs stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire‚Äôs equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.

Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.

It‚Äôs not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was ‚Äúprobably a mistake.‚Äù Also it‚Äôs not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.

Even with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple‚Äôs largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they‚Äôre doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024","9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Will the ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù Exit Impact Apple Stock.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.

"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)‚Äôs blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on¬†[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the¬†[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)¬†follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday‚Äôs close. The new calculations show¬†[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)¬†as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia‚Äôs weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

‚ÄúUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they‚Äôre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what‚Äôs beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,‚Äù Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

‚ÄúIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,‚Äù Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

Algorithms run the entire market through options. EVERY SINGLE STOCK IS ILLIQUID.,"****update**** I‚Äôve looked at the option chain for several tickers and large quantities of puts have been placed/added right under max pain this week which I believe are manufacturered dumps through the option market.  I think big dumps coming across across the market and OTM the money puts will be ITM by end of day.  BIG DUMP.  ***Please don‚Äôt trade options on max pain.  Option chain gives us a prediction of how the day might play out and looking deeper into the option chains should be done before buying options.***  I‚Äôm not giving financial advice

I‚Äôve spent the last several weeks staring at different stocks in active trader and I believe the entire market is illiquid.  EVERY. SINGLE. STOCK.  After watching charts and option chains for very high volume tickers like Apple, Tesla and Ford (and others that experience big spikes and drops), all prices move back to ‚Äúmax pain‚Äù for the week.  Apple max pain this week is 172.50.  I‚Äôve watched all week - stock under 172.50 it will move up.  Stock above 172.50 it will move back down.  Stock will end the week at max pain so the least amount of options trigger.  The lower the better, less shares have to be found.  

I believe all this is done through the option chain, option creation and execution by market makers algorithms.  To keep the market ‚Äúliquid‚Äù.  It‚Äôs why we see huge swings in Tesla.  There are no shares.

We also see huge swings in the morning, afternoon or other random times in the entire market.  It shoots straight up, why?  It‚Äôs dipping too low and too close to the danger zone which would trigger a high volume, rapid sell off bc a high volume of puts will begin to auto exercise (dumping the price lower and loss of paper collateral).  Shoots straight down?  Calls begin auto exercising through algos shooting the price higher and higher.  Can‚Äôt have that bc there are no shares available to deliver.

Some additional thoughts:

Maybe the algos were turned up during the pandemic crash bc if it didn‚Äôt another world economic crash.  It‚Äôs why it just keeps climbing and climbing?  Using leverage through options to prop the stock market back up?

We might see AH price moves based on close price in relation to ‚Äúmax pain‚Äù.  Maybe they are covering or rebalancing/creating new options.

Any outside influence/news/buying shares throws option algos off and huge swings start.  We are seeing this more and more in individual stocks and across the market. The market becomes more sensitive with any outside influence and creates bigger and bigger swings.

GME started it all.

Ps. Check out the close price of Apple üòâ
Update: AAPL AH has moved around between $.20 with an AH volume of 5 million!!!! What?!?!

Edit - additional thoughts

Entire market run through option market.  Lots option buyers just sell off options they bought at a profit and never intend to exercise.  Quick easy money for swing trading at a low cost.  

Any stock in your account are fake shares - whether it‚Äôs GME or Netflix.  GME started rising quickly when option traders/holders exercised their calls and real shares had to be found.  It created a chain reaction, leading to more and more calls exercising and a trading frenzy of retail buyers buying shares (not options) moving the price to quickly.  There was no hedge or strike prices for the MM to create downward pressure through the option chain and retail wasn‚Äôt selling  only holding.

It‚Äôs why options have been discouraged.  It is very obvious they move GME down through the option. They don‚Äôt want us to have that power.  The option chain now has $1 strike price increments.  When was that added.  Downward pressure at every $1!

Are MM/hf creating options through borrowed shares?  100,000 equals 1,000 puts.  This week‚Äôs option chain has between 100-200 puts at each strike from $130.  

My mind is going haywire making more and more connections.

We should be looking at patterns through the option chain.  Not charts, charts don‚Äôt matter.  Options do.

ITM calls should be exercised immediately, as soon as profitable (share cost plus premium)!",4446
NVDA will drop to 800 tomorrow because:,"1. SMCI and AMD‚Äôs failure to perform will continue to bring the semiconductor market down tomorrow.

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",1199
Nobody owns apple stock,"I scroll through countless ""rate my portfolio"" threads, and Apple never appears.

My 5 year old Beat my Returns Again in 2022.,"Year end and I‚Äôm down 19%. My 5 year old daughter is down 14%! For comparison sake the S&P500 is down 18.11%. She has a Schwab UGMA account and gets $50/mo and has been picking a stock a month since she turned 4 (20 months ago). Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Domino‚Äôs, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc‚Ä¶) and usually driven by questions like, ‚Äúcan I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock?‚Äù And ‚Äúcan I buy YouTube stock?‚Äù Or ‚Äúmom shops at Target‚Äù and ‚ÄúI like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.‚Äù

"Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html

‚ÄúApple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple‚Äôs rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple‚Äôs rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple‚Äôs latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple‚Äôs manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel‚Äôs own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple‚Äôs future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple‚Äôs rise to $3 trillion hasn‚Äôt been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it ‚Äúcomplies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.‚Äù

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple‚Äôs control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.‚Äù",4103
Ryan Cohens Kill Shot....the Reverse Merger,"**What's RC plan, does he have a plan?**

&#x200B;

[This Guy Fucks](https://preview.redd.it/u187w1yyxrx61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=eba4369c1f55655cae2c4603de8d74fa4dd2c44b)

Here is what I think Ryan Cohens plan is

[REVERSE Merger](https://preview.redd.it/e7c3rodiyrx61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=356944c81ec0e08be4da473605260def8e819f75)

Ok I have heard allot of talk about stock splits, reverse splits, dividends or crypto dividends ect on how RC can shake the shorts.

None of those really go the whole way. Reverse split is out of the question as the stock is not liquid enough, and there is legal questions surrounding the crypto dividend. [OVERSTOCK](https://www.coindesk.com/after-lawsuits-and-delays-overstock-hands-shareholders-digital-dividend)

Also none of these moves benefit Ryan Cohen and GameStop at the same time.  They may hurt the shorts or help retail investors but none of the options help Gamestop and RC at the sametime.

I have [Posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwy324/can_ryan_cohen_increase_his_ownership_to_199/) and others have thought about RC buying more GameStop, after reviewing the filings **he can buy up to 20% of the company at any point.**  This whole time I have been waiting for him to buy, and thinking that he is waiting for volume to dry up, or to save his ammo to protect the stock if the price starts to fall.

but there is a serious flaw in that thinking......it doesn't help Gamestop.

I lay out the timeline of RC and GameStop below more in-depth below, but at this point RC has control of the board and the chairmanship, he doesn't need to buy anymore stock the way normal people do.

GameStop, with the help of RC and his marry band of Apes has erased its long term debt (minus leases) and raised 555m (a nice down payment on the transformation)

Ryan Cohen wants to own more of GME, most owner/ceo own over 20% of the companies they run.

He is totally invested in the GameStop turnaround, the best thing he can do is a **Reverse Merger.**

He capitalizes RC ventures with allot of money (500m, 750m, 1.5b) he can even bring in other private investors.

RC Ventures and GME merge, they create a Holding Company that they both merge into.  The holding company is renamed Gamestop and eventually trades as GME under a **new CUSIP#**

**How does it help Ryan Cohen**\- He gets ownership of whatever % of the stock at the agreed upon merger price (it would be the same amount as if he bought on the open market)

H**ow does it help Gamestop**\- they actually get the **CAPITAL,** if Ryan buys on the open market they don't get the money they sold that stock when they issued it.  this way Ryan gets to infuse the company with much needed cash and increase his ownership stake at the same time.

You are probable asking

HOW DOES IT HELP APE - Did you gloss over the part about the CUSIP#...here read this

[Example 1](https://groovevc.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-remarkable-short-squeeze/) or [https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/)

"" Changing the stock cusip number results in each share with the old cusip number having to be exchanged for a share with the new cusip number, which causes each short position to have to prove the borrow. Naked short positions would be unable to comply and those positions could have to be covered by purchasing shares with the new cusip on the open market. ""

Now the reverse split or the reverse merger has been tried before and it does squeeze the stock price a bit, but then it goes right back down.  Typically this is because it is done on Penny Stocks and the shorts can simply cover as its not that expensive or there is not as many Naked shorts as people think.

but what if there is a ton of **NAKED SHORTS,** then those **SHORTS ARE FUCKED.**  If they sold a bunch of shares naked and kept doing it without ever thinking they would need to be returned they would be foreced to buy a TON of GME under the new CUSIP #

Meta employees are looking to leave jobs as their stock based compensation has plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months,"Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months ‚Äì and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. ‚ÄúJoined Meta near [all time stock high], now feeling like shit,‚Äù one Meta employee said this week in a popular thread on Blind, a corporate message board with verified members. ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù ‚ÄúLeave this crap place,‚Äù another ‚ÄúMetamate‚Äù responded, according to the New York Post. ‚ÄúSame boat,‚Äù a third said, adding that they‚Äôre ‚Äúalready interviewing‚Äù at other companies. ‚ÄúDuh, you‚Äôre supposed to think Meta, Metamates, and me. Ask yourself if this train of thought is good for the company,‚Äù a fourth joked. ‚ÄúJust kidding ‚Ä¶ it super sucks.‚Äù

Meta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $US380 ($A512) in September to $US216.49 ($A292) at the time of writing. The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. ‚ÄúPeople are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,‚Äù Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. ‚ÄúI think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this ‚Äì if this could be the beginning of the end for them.‚Äù When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company‚Äôs average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company‚Äôs stock rockets ‚Äì but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.

For example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company‚Äôs September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies ‚Äì such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year ‚Äì can theoretically ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled ‚ÄúMetamate‚Äôs‚Äù post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: ‚ÄúThe only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I‚Äôm doing exactly that and headed to Meta.‚Äù Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,‚Äù Ms Martin told The Post. ‚ÄúI agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.‚Äù

ARM will drop after the bell because,"1. Declining sales for mobile chips - Apple recently announced the decline for iPhones was 10% this quarter. The only reason their stock pumped up was due to their share buy back announced. ARM will not have this luxury and decreasing demand will hurt them
2. Previous guidance was made under the assumption of 3 rate cuts this year. We are down to maybe 1? This had hurt SMCI as well as AMD two chip manufacturers who build chips using ARM's archecture... suffice to say guidance will be poor hurting their stock price against Wall Streets insane expectations for chip manufacturers
3. I have NVDA calls (expiring May 24th) , one of ARM's biggest customers, thus by proxy my calls are gonna tank after close. Honestly debating on buying ARM puts (expiring this Friday) to hedge but IV crush is gonna be a bitch with this one

Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard.,"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP? You'll still have your job.",1856

I lay out the timeline of RC and GameStop below more in-depth below, but at this point RC has control of the board and the chairmanship, he doesn't need to buy anymore stock the way normal people do.

GameStop, with the help of RC and his marry band of Apes has erased its long term debt (minus leases) and raised 555m (a nice down payment on the transformation)

Ryan Cohen wants to own more of GME, most owner/CEO own over 20% of the companies they run.

He is totally invested in the GameStop turnaround, the best thing he can do is a **Reverse Merger.**

He capitalizes RC ventures with allot of money (500m, 750m, 1.5b) he can even bring in other private investors.

RC Ventures and GME merge, they create a Holding Company that they both merge into. The holding company is renamed Gamestop and eventually trades as GME under a **new CUSIP#**

**How does it help Ryan Cohen**\- He gets ownership of whatever % of the stock at the agreed upon merger price (it would be the same amount as if he bought on the open market)

H**ow does it help Gamestop**\- they actually get the **CAPITAL,** if Ryan buys on the open market they don't get the money they sold that stock when they issued it. this way Ryan gets to infuse the company with much needed cash and increase his ownership stake at the same time.

You are probable asking

HOW DOES IT HELP APE - Did you gloss over the part about the CUSIP#...here read this

[Example 1](https://groovevc.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-remarkable-short-squeeze/) or [https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/)

"" Changing the stock cusip number results in each share with the old cusip number having to be exchanged for a share with the new cusip number, which causes each short position to have to prove the borrow. Naked short positions would be unable to comply and those positions could have to be covered by purchasing shares with the new cusip on the open market. ""

Now the reverse split or the reverse merger has been tried before and it does squeeze the stock price a bit, but then it goes right back down. Typically this is because it is done on Penny Stocks and the shorts can simply cover as its not that expensive or there is not as many Naked shorts as people think.

but what if there is a ton of **NAKED SHORTS,** then those **SHORTS ARE FUCKED.** If they sold a bunch of shares naked and kept doing it without ever thinking they would need to be returned they would be foreced to buy a TON of GME under the new CUSIP #

**ADDITION More research and DD need to be done on how a merger or reverse merger affects users on ETTORO**
https://www.etoro.com/posts/0__entry__19ed9016-5e15-4642-be20-64b8dc9bb89f
Adding alpha merger info from Etoro.  My take is not to worry if you are on Etoro, there would be a minimum 30 day period from the announcement of a merger to an actual merger, probably more. So the stock would squeeze during that period not after. Also any merger would cause a change in cusip number.

Remember Citadel Securities is the DMM for GME right now if they change their cusip number they can change DMM OR CHANGE EXCHANGES.

I have been writing a DD where I believe that Citadel and SUS has been stashing their Naked options sales or Naked short sales in [Sold not yet purchased liabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n6mj3h/knight_capital_groupthe_precursor_to_citadel_part/) which are Ballooning.

Oh and GME has done this before when the merged with EB games

I have been thinking it is Funds selling out to cash out or to cover your position. Probably covering the position as apple it is safe haven stock.

but what if it was someone ready to go .....all in on GME

yeah crazy theory

Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia‚Äôs milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company‚Äôs pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry‚Äôs need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units.

CAUGHT RED HANDED! TOKENIZED STOCKS DE-PEGGED TO MAINTAIN MARGIN FOR SWAP POSITIONS!,"**Mods please mark as debunked. My research for Part 5 was flawed. When i was doing research for Part 5, I used coinbase which i later learned grabs the info from coinmarketcap.com. And i used their current numbers for that part vs current stock. Most of those numbers were updated 131 hours ago. Which makes it outdated. 

Someone is still trading GME tokenized stock on DeFiChain DEX though. No idea why. But regardless, my conclusions don't make sense now given part 5 is wrong

I still stand by Veris being used for equity swaps and tokenized stocks being used for those swaps. But disregard everything else. Please downvote post to remove from top of page** 

~~Ladies and Gentlemen, we got em!~~

~~TLDR: Tokenized stocks are used for blockchain equity swaps. These tokens have been de-pegged, meaning the value of the token and stock is not 1:1. They are intentionally keeping the token either higher or lower, depending whether they are short or long that security. Given the swap is based on the value of the token and not the equity, they are manipulating their positions within the swap~~

~~Please check out the DD/Speculation I uploaded yesterday for context:~~ [~~https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/yx7geo/total\_return\_equity\_swaps\_are\_connected\_to/~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/yx7geo/total_return_equity_swaps_are_connected_to/)

~~TLDR of this DD: Banks and Hedge Funds are using Veris developed by Axoni. Axoni is a blockchain solution for equity swaps. Veris allows for all parties on a trade to match and confirm all trade terms upfront and remain synchronized on post-trade events such as amendments, positions, and cash flows through the lifecycle of the swap. Axoni uses tokenized stocks for its blockchain solution which are pegged 1:1 to the equity they are representing.~~

u/dibrickishaw ~~was able to confirm this in his own post (check it out) by finding an article which states: ""But the exchange (Binance) does not provide a formal investment prospectus that would be required if it were deemed the stock tokens constituted ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù under European regulations. CM-Equity said the product was Mifid II compliant and~~ **~~worked as a certificate for a¬†total return swap.~~**~~""~~

**~~Part 5: FTX Collapse and de-pegging of tokenized stocks~~**

~~Tokenized stocks have de-pegged from the securities they are supposed to represent. GME tokenized price: $24.89 | GME Stock Price $27.76. Most tokenized securities dropped in value. I assumed this was due to FTX collapse and all tokens were now slowly dying off.~~

~~Well this was false. Not all tokenized stocks dropped. GameStop token dropped, Popcorn token dropped, and many others. However I managed to find a few that didn't drop but increased in value relative to the equity they are supposed to represent and some that dropped in value.~~

~~Amazon stock: $94.85 | Amazon Token: $107.00~~

~~Tesla: $183.17 | Tesla Token: $189.50~~

~~Apple: $150.72 | Apple Token: $153.34~~

~~Nvidia: $156.77 | Nvidia Token: $145.40~~

~~Pfizer: $48.33 | Pfizer Token: $$45.00~~

**~~Part 6: I see you Citadel~~**

~~This doesn't really make sense. Why are some up and some down? Maybe due to demand? Maybe FTX blowing up? But who is still buying these shit coins!?~~

~~Do you know what GameStop and Popcorn have in common? They are shorted by hedge funds/banks. These tokens are lower than current stock price.~~

~~Do you know what Amazon, Tesla, Apple have in common? They are held by Citadel and used as collateral. These tokens are higher than current stock price.~~

[~~https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Citadel+Advisors~~](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Citadel+Advisors)

~~Do you know what Nvidia and Pfizer have in common? Nothing. Irrelevant to this saga as far as am aware.  These tokens are lower than their stock price. (Everything short theory)~~

**~~Part 7: Conclusion and Speculation~~**

~~I believe that tokenized stocks are used for collateral and for equity swaps purposes which is utilized by blockchain solution Veris.~~

~~I believe tokenized securities were de-pegged in order to prevent hedge fund/banks equity swaps from blowing up. Increase the token price of their collateral for more collateral and lower the token price of the short for lower margin requirements.~~

~~Veris blockchain solution is literally living in a detached world to make sure the equity swap positions on the platform do not blow up. Therefore they are manipulating the token price which affects Veris and their swap positions. If their equity swaps were not on that blockchain solution, I suspect they would've blew up by now. Clever but very fraudulent strategy. Anything for one more day. This is why they are holding their swaps on blockchain. Because tokens can be manipulated to not be part of reality.~~

Parents are buying in xxx after my drunk Thanksgiving Dinner rant!,"Hey SuperStonk, 
Long story short I got a few apple cider margaritas deep & like to talk. Initially it started with macro economics & the friday bloodbath around the market. Progressed into MSM manipulation & settled down on the ingenious naming of ‚Äúmeme stock,‚Äù how  this name was given to discount the legitimacy of our stock & its fundamentals. 

Anyways my dad brought up how GME happened in January (they know I was invested then) & asked deeper about why. 

Went on a rant starting with January sneeze, then leading into SECs report on it, into DDs such as House of Cards, Emperor has No Clothes, etc. 

As of market open on Monday, my parents decided to put in enough to become xxx holders. And it was made extremely clear, no financial advice or pressure was given. They decided it was a worth while investment on their own accord. 

For those wondering: yes these will be bought via CS. 

I believe there‚Äôs many other instances like my own & we will see a new wave of boomer apes. 

TLDR; parents decided to invest xxx shares via ComputerShare after my drunken Thanksgiving dinner rant.",6343

Little info to OBV (thx ChatGPT):

The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is an indicator used in stock market analysis to measure the cumulative buying and selling pressure of a particular stock. It provides insights into the strength of the trend and helps traders identify potential reversals or confirm existing trends.

OBV is based on the idea that volume precedes price movement. It takes into account the volume traded during periods when the price of a stock increases or decreases. The concept behind OBV is that when volume is higher on up days (days when the stock price closes higher) compared to down days (days when the stock price closes lower), it suggests that buyers are more active and bullish on the stock.

OBV is calculated by adding the volume on up days and subtracting the volume on down days. If the price of a stock closes higher than the previous day, the volume is added to the cumulative OBV. If the price closes lower, the volume is subtracted. If the price remains unchanged, the volume is ignored.

A rising OBV indicates buying pressure, suggesting that the stock is in an uptrend. Conversely, a declining OBV indicates selling pressure and a potential downtrend. Traders often look for divergences between OBV and price to identify possible trend reversals. For example, if the stock price is rising, but the OBV is falling, it could be a sign of weakening buying pressure and a potential upcoming price decline.

\-------------------------------------

Asked the Bot one more question - choose your answer

If the OBV consistently remains high and even increases while the stock price goes down over time, it indicates a significant divergence between the price and the volume-based indicator. There are a few possible reasons why this may occur:

1. Accumulation Phase: It's possible that institutional investors or large market participants are accumulating the stock during this period. Despite the declining price, their buying activity is reflected in the increasing OBV. This could be due to a long-term investment strategy or anticipation of future positive developments for the company.
2. Overlooked Value: The market may be undervaluing the stock despite its declining price. Investors who recognize this undervaluation and believe in the long-term prospects of the company might be accumulating shares. The increasing OBV would indicate their buying activity, potentially in anticipation of a future price recovery.
3. Sector or Market Factors: The declining stock price could be influenced by broader market or sector trends, impacting multiple stocks in the same industry. If investors view the overall sector as undervalued or believe that the broader market conditions will improve, they might accumulate shares of specific stocks within that sector, leading to a higher OBV.
4. Manipulation or Misinterpretation: In rare cases, unusual trading activities or manipulation can distort the OBV. It's important to consider the quality and reliability of the volume data used to calculate the OBV. If there are inaccuracies or anomalies in the reported volume, it may lead to misleading conclusions.

"I just deposited $7k into brokerage, age 28, which of these stocks would you buy in for long term?","Posting this right before work so forgive me for not being super detailed, will try my best to make this relevant for everyone and not just me about these 3 stocks I want to know opinions on for long term: 

Tesla 

Apple 

Sofi 

I own Tesla because.... It is Tesla. People in my honest opinion want to believe they will only be making vehicles in the future. Not the case if Elon Musk gets his way (check out the Tesla bot for example, not to mention space travel, etc). Before today held 2 shares of Tesla, plan on buying 2 more. 

Apple is a good long term buy and hold because it is Apple of course. I do not believe the Apple car that should be releasing in the next 3 years has been priced in to the stock at all yet. I could see Apple being worth over $500/share say 3 years from now. Before today held 14 shares of Apple, plan on buying 10 more. 

Sofi is an underdog stock. I could see this stock going much further down, possibly to/below $10 a share again. Sofi is by definition loosing money, and it is the outlier compared to say a Tesla or an Apple stock... However I see it as being revolutionary when it comes to financial products for the everyday person. As a millennial most of my friends from around the United States seem to know more about Sofi than Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc. I would be shocked if Sofi is not worth $40 a share this time next year. Before today held 48 shares, will be buying 25 more today, and will wait for a potential dip below $12 - if that happens will buy as many shares as I can. 

Tell me if I am missing anything with these stocks, and for us readers in similar situations, maybe a few stocks to consider purchasing in lieu of any of the above 3?",293

Natural FOMO was always the correct play to trigger MOASS. RC knew GS's rabid investor base would handle it themselves.,"It seems like everyone round here feels pretty fucking good lately. Which is an amazing statement in and of itself. 

HOW? How is it even possible that a group of retail investors in a single stock can be so calm in this bizarre, frightening, chaotic market?

The stock market is crashing further and further every week. The S&P is down 20+% since January. The FED can't raise rates fast enough to get inflation under control without triggering massive debt defaults. Whales are liquidating crypto in order to gain liquidity, tanking the entire speculative market. The housing market is showing signs of collapse. Gas is pegged to $5 a gallon. Food prices are sky-high. Everything is pointing to a massive stagflation recession if not outright depression.

Gamestop investors? Well the stock is down about 8% since January 1st. Can you believe that? In this market? Only 8%.

How about some of the blue chips?

Google? Down 25%. Apple? Ditto 25% down.

How about Best Buy? Ya know, a very similar store to Gamestop? Down 29%.

Amazon? 36%! Tesla? 38%! Netflix? DOWN SEVENTY PERCENT.

Everyone here knows why inflation is the way it is (J POWELL BRRRRR) and why companies are taking a massive beating. The stock market is a corrupt ponzi scheme designed to rug-pull the expendable income of the average American OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 401K's wiped out. Life savings gone.

Ryan Cohen saw this coming. He watched while a single man with a red headband pointed out the play of the century. He watched when Robinhood turned the buy button off. He watched when the shills on CNBC shit on him and his company over and over again for 18 months.

Why did he watch? Becuase it's not his job to go on CNBC and complain. It's not his job to call out the corruption on Wall Street and the SEC.

IT'S HIS JOB TO FUCKING WORK.

The man implemented an incredible turnaround strategy of Gamestop that is about to start bearing fruit. You really think all these incredible hires of all-star talent would be happy with stock options of a company that was trading at 5 dollars a share two years ago without know what's going to happen?

He knows what's coming. He knows the shorts are fucked. He knows that every day the Liquidity Fairy can't find shit for Gamestop. He sees the borrow rates. He sees the DRS numbers. He sees the FTD's. He sees Melvin going under. He sees the overleveraged hedge funds drowning. He sees all of the blue chips getting destroyed.

All the while. $GME? Flying higher and higher. Stable as they come. The most stable stock in the whole fucking market.

MOASS was never about RC doing some sneaky trick move to make us all rich while he gets stuck in court for stock manipulation for the next decade.

MOASS was always about FOMO. It's about watching the rest of the market realize all along that the confident reddit kids were right and that this is the one. The only true play. It's about the Boomers piling in with their life savings. It's about the rich fucks turning on each other hoping to survive. The DD's done. This investor base is ZEN.

Who's ready for the fucking ride of their lives? Power to the players.",3923

Technology stocks are crashing ‚Äì what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.",4052
NVDA $1000 highly likely now,"There‚Äôs a gravity well type effect in the stock market.  Whenever a stock or an index gets within spitting distance of a key price point, it will always gravitates to that price point.  

Nvidia is now too close to the $1000 to stop and peak early.  Chances are we‚Äôll see $1000 this year regardless of what comes next.

The broader market is way overdue for a correction.  So Nvidia may pull back a bit. 

But once the next leg up begins in the market, nvidia goes to $1000.  

If the market doesn‚Äôt peak in the next few weeks ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a very high probably that it will given certain time/price oscillator I don‚Äôt want to go get into ‚Äî then Nvidia will likely see $1000 in the next four weeks. 

So it‚Äôs either (1) market peak, market correction, bottom and next leg higher by mid-summer = Nvidia $1000 by fall; or (2) market goes sideways and Nvidia grinds to $1000 in the next four weeks.  

Once Nvidia does reach $1000 ‚Äî and it very much will ‚Äî it will probably run to as high as $1200-$1300 before it has its first massive correction that brings it down 30-40%.  Like Tesla or Apple or google or every other stock that saw rapid repricing.  

And this has NOTHING to do with fundamental.  It‚Äôs all profit taking, technicals driven.  

When a stock reprices rapidly like Nvidia justifiably has, it will crash and burn.  No matter how strong the fundamentals are.  

Don‚Äôt believe me.  Go look at apple in 2012. It had STRONGER fundamentals than Nvidia had right now RELATIVE to its price.  

Apple was trading at an 19 P/E ratio growing at 100% a year with massive future expected growth.  Everyone had consensus $1000+ price targets on Apple and it was all justified.  And Apple did surpass that $1000 by several thousand (post split) but not before it crashed and everyone freaked out.  

At peak high 19 TRIALING P/E ratio, Apple fell from $705 down to $388 and traded under a 10 P/E ratio and had 65% of its market cap in cash.  It could have taken itself private if stayed there for any extended period of it.  It didn‚Äôt.  

And there was not a solitary reason anyone could point to.  There was no earnings slowdown.  No earnings miss.  Nothing.  The fundamental were stock as can be.  

The stock simply rallied from $150 the year earlier all the way to $705.  People took profits and the stock fell 40% down to $388.  It then rallied back to $700 split, did it again, split again and did it again and split again.  

Just saying.  Get ready for the ride.  It will for sure crash.  Once it reaches $1000, you‚Äôre an idiot if you continue holding.  Unless you‚Äôre a long term investor and don‚Äôt mind the roller coaster ride from $1200 to $600 back up to $1200 again.  In which case, enjoy.  ",89
Volume the final frontier and why itll help you make money,"I made this to help you noobs who dont know shit about stocks. This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you

Volume

-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering

-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both

-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume

-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal

-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in

-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil

-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in

-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent 

-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again

-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday‚Äôs, it means that a trend is likely to continue 

-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm

-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week

-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.

-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there

-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity 

-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal 

-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts

- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight

-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls

-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies

Angry lady really wanted some candy apples.,"So I went to Aldi today on my lunch break from work. I was shopping for ingredients to make hard apple cider. I found the only apple juice Aldi sold without preservatives and loaded up my cart with a dozen half gallon bottles and kept them in their cardboard boxes so they would be easier to transport. There were a few other items I needed to pick up so I pushed my cart through the store shopping for them. A woman noticed the boxes of apple juice in my cart and asked where I had found them. I had nothing better to do, so I walked her over to the apple juice display where she thanked me. Another woman immediately came up to me and asked,

""You used to have these candy apples in the store but I can't find them. Where are they?""

I had no idea where they were so I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't know - I don't work here.""

Her eyes narrowed and she responded, ""What do you mean you don't work here? I just saw you help that other person.""

Now, I am in a t-shirt and corduroy pants and don't look at all as if I would be working at this store. I could tell that this was not going to go well no matter what I said, but I attempted to be polite, ""I'm sorry, ma'am. She asked me where I had found this apple juice so I showed her. I don't actually work here.""

""What do you mean you don't work here?!""

""I don't work here. I am a customer, like you.""

""Just tell me where the candy apples are!""

At this point it was getting weird. ""I really don't know where the candy apples are. I don't work here.""

""You don't know where anything is in this store?!""

""I know where the apple juice is.""

""WHERE ARE THE CANDY APPLES?!""

""Ma'am, I'm sorry I can't help you. I really don't work here.""

""WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!""

""It means that I don't work at this store. I don't know where the candy apples are. I am a customer like you.""

""THEN WHY ARE YOU STOCKING THE SHELVES?!"" She indicated the boxes in my cart filled with apple juice.""

""I am shopping I am going to buy what is in my cart...""

""NOBODY NEEDS THAT MUCH JUICE! YOU WORK HERE AND YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE THE CANDY APPLES ARE!"" At this point everyone around us had stopped and were staring.

An Aldi shelf stocker came over and said, ""Ma'am, the candy apples were a seasonal item and I'm afraid we are sold out.""

The woman glared at the Aldi employee, and then me and said, indicating me, ""WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT?!""

""He doesn't work here, Ma'am.""

The woman then roared in exasperation, pushed her cart into an aisle display of canned food, knocking it over and screamed, ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!! I AM NEVER COMING BACK!""

She stormed out of the store, fuming. The employee gave me with a WTF look, which I returned, then I proceeded to checkout.

I loaded the juice into the trunk of my car and hopped in the driver seat. I checked my mirrors before backing out and noticed that the candy apple lady was in the SUV to my left, sitting in her driver seat, sobbing.

I rolled down my window and waved to get her attention. She noticed me, waited about 15 seconds, then rolled down her window.

""Are you OK, ma'am?"" I asked.

Through sobs and tears she said, ""I said I would bring candy apples to my grandson's party.""

I asked her when the party was to take place and she told me 'tonight'. I told her that I had seen kits to make candy apples over at Safeway, and that if she made them now they should be ready by the time of the party.

Her eyes lit up and she looked at me, ""Thank you.""

""You're welcome.""

I went back to work.

**Have you wondered recently with reported Short Interest of GME so low (26% of float according to MarketBeat), how has GME gone down more than 50% in the past 5 days with relatively low volume?**

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting GME directly?** *YES*, but that alone is not enough to drive down GME price drastically without significant increase in reported short interest.

**Are Citadel and Friends hiding short interest thorough OTC (dark pools) and other shady options mechanisms?** *Likely yes*, but will not explore in this post.

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting ETFs directly that contain GME?** *YES*, but that‚Äôs not the entire picture

**Isn‚Äôt shorting an ETF that only contains 1-5% GME expensive and cost prohibitive?**

*NO*, and here‚Äôs why.

# Operational Shorting ‚Äì Naked Shorting ETFs at a PROFIT for Citadel

**What Is an ETF?** An exchange traded fund (ETF) is like a basket of stocks that can be purchased or sold on an exchange like a single regular stock.

**Rise of ETFs** are concerning since they constitute a disproportionately high amount of US trading volume. 25% of all US equity trading volume, but only constitute 5% market cap.

**Why is there such a high ETF trading volume?** Answer: Its profitable for the APs

**What is an AP?** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF) like big banks or market makers like Citadel

**How does Citadel make money on selling / buying ETFs?**

**Arbitrage**. The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrage Analogy:**

Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket, and the stocks they contain fruits. Say the XRT fruit basket was $6 and contained a banana (GME), orange, and apple. And individual bananas are $1, oranges are $2, and apples are $3.  The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV (net asset value) which in this case is also $6. Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn‚Äôt make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV. In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy ‚Äì Operational Shorting.

https://preview.redd.it/ws8rv6rw68p61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03cfb7f45ca8f7b93602f91a3cf3e9c73c99e63

**Operational Shorting Analogy:**

Citadel has the ability to NAKED SELL nonexistent fruit baskets (XRT / IWM) at $6 but not deliver on them until 6 days later. Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits (bananas went from $1 -> $0.5, oranges to $1.8, apples to $2.7), only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you. That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel (0.5 + 1.8 + 2.7 = $5) to make, netting them a cool $1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50%.

# Operational Shorting by Citadel

When faced with ‚Äúexcess buying‚Äù pressure for ETF shares, **the AP/MM can sell shares ‚Äúnaked‚Äù and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for ‚Äúbona fide‚Äù market making)**

Market makers, often commercial banks or hedge funds, create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent. ***But they've discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange-traded fund shares that they will create later***. These transactions are a form of shorting ‚Äì Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans, Professor at the Darden School of Business.

&#x200B;

# Okay.. What does this mean for GME?

**Citadel is willing to NAKED SHORT ANY ETF containing GME**, and by extension the **ENTIRE MARKET** (will show later) to drive down the price of GME.

# If Citadel Shorted ETFs to Drive Down GME Price, Why Did It Go Up Today?

SEC Rules that Citadel must deliver on naked ETF shorts by T+6 by buying back the underlying shares. Today lines up just under this restriction from the first time IWM was shorted on Mar 18.

# Should Operational Shorting Make Apes Scared? 

**Operational Shorting HAS NO PREDICTIVE VALUE ON THE PRICE OF UNDERLYING ASSETS 1 WEEK LATER. Unless apes scared and paper hand**

Citadel MUST buy back the underlying stock on ETFs sold short at (T+6) WHICH MEANS IF YOU DON'T PAPER HAND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BUY BACK GME AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN WHEN THEY STARTED SHORTING

# Conclusion

Findings from Evan‚Äôs paper on ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting?

>If higher levels of FTDs spill over from one ETF to another within the same AP or across different APs with overlap in their ETF market making activities, **operational shorting could increase financial instability**. When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs, **we find evidence consistent with this contagion-like effect**. Moreover, we also find that **APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short**. These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter-connected network of liquidity providers which, at times, pursue positively correlated **trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market.**‚Äù

&#x200B;

**Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages**

* APs who are operationally short in one ETF, are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP (intra-AP linkage)
   * Proof in point: Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb, and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again
* A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting (inter-AP linkage)
   * Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs
* Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage, **we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit, the higher levels of operational shorting.** **This is consistent with a contagion-like effect that could cause entire market instability.**

&#x200B;

# CITADEL AND FRIENDS ARE FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK.

# UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.

# EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

# I WILL HOLD MY BANANAS TO THE MOON

**Edit:** To clarify, my summary is that naked shorting of ETFs is easy and profitable for the APs. And while operational shorting has no net effect on the NAV of all the stocks in an ETF, they have realized it is an effective way to drive and magnify the direction of a single stock in the ETF in the direction they want it to go via other methods like direct shorting of GME.

Translation: today's rise may have been premediated by the APs since they knew they had to cover from shorting IWM 5 days ago. **Whether GME keeps rising after today no one can answer and specific dates don't matter since APs have multiple strategies to delay or shorten the delivery dates on shares sold short**. THE most effective way for **me** to deal with APs who have become more and more leveraged is to **just buy and hold**. üíé üíé üíé

Is your 401k down? So is everyone else‚Äôs.,"Like every other question lately has been along the lines of asking what people ought to do with their negative return retirement accounts. Here are the basics in case it helps.

## Basics

* 401k plans (and IRAs and any other investment vehicle) are not cash accounts. The money you contribute purchases assets like equities/stocks and bonds.
* These assets change in value. Apple stock was once worth $22/share. It‚Äôs now closer to $145/share. In Dec 2021 the price was $180/share. In other words, values go up AND down.
* This change in prices does NOT matter to you so long as you‚Äôre a long way from retirement. Why? Because over the long term prices mostly go up.
* If you ARE closer to retirement you do indeed need to look at allocation (split between stocks/equities and bonds or more stable assets) to keep your portfolio stable. The cost of stability is slow growth.

## Why are prices dropping so much right now?

* Inflation is very high. In the long term inflation is very dangerous. It eats away at everyone‚Äôs standard of living. So the Federal Reserve is VERY focused on taming inflation.
* The way they try to get this done is by raising interests rates on money lent to banks. That is, it‚Äôs more expensive for banks to borrow money. In turn, banks charge you and I and companies a higher interest rate to borrow from them. Fewer people borrow. Economic activity slows. Demand for goods and services slows. And prices come down. This is the theory.
* If the Fed overshoots (raises rates too quickly or too much) we get a slow economy that could tip into a recession. If the Fed undershoots (doesn‚Äôt raise rates enough or quickly enough) the economy stays hot and inflation can continue to rise.
* So, companies and people are basically skeptical of the idea that the Fed can thread the needle and give us a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù, where inflation is lowered but the economy stays warm. This negative outlook (along with geo-political turmoil and supply chain issues) is why stock prices are down. Turns out, the stock market is very sensitive to how people are feeling.

## What should you do?

* Assuming you have a stable job, a solid emergency fund, and are a long way from retirement you should do nothing. That is, you should not change your plans at all. If you had a set % contribution from each paycheck going into your 401k, keep it.
* If you can afford to, increasing contributions means you‚Äôll be buying assets while they‚Äôre cheap. [u/LoganSquire made a point below about this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xs3mr1/is_your_401k_down_so_is_everyone_elses/iqj4345/)

## What should you NOT do?

* You should NOT stop contributing if you can afford to keep contributing.
* You should NOT be cashing out. There are fees and penalties associated with this action if you‚Äôre talking about a retirement/tax advantaged account. But many people still think they should cash out and buy back in at lower prices. This is called timing the market and you cannot do it. Traders on Wall Street get paid millions to try to do this as their full time job and even they lose tons of money all the time. The last time people wanted to cash out en mass was in March 2020 when people panicking about COVID said the market was gonna crash. Then prices soared to new highs and people were left with no choice but to buy back in at very high prices. NO ONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALL.
* You should NOT be checking your balance daily. Just leave it alone. Save yourself the stress. In fact, looking at balances is a little deceptive. That‚Äôs not cash in the account, remember. It‚Äôs cumulative value of the assets you own. So you haven‚Äôt lost anything unless you decide to sell those assets at prices lower than what you paid original.

That‚Äôs the gist of it.

EDIT: A few comments mentioned that people might continue to contribute but change their allocation to something ""safer"", which might slow the bleeding until markets pick back up. There is hidden danger in this.

Take this example. Stock prices go from $10 -> $3 -> $11 per share over a 12 month period. During that same period a safer more conservative asset remains at a steady $7 per share.

Scenario 1: keep contributing $100/month into all stocks.

Scenario 2: $100/mo split between stocks and the conservative asset. Stocks when stock price is above $7. Conservative asset when stock price is at or below $7.

Although the losses are less for the second scenario for a time, the gains are greater in the end for scenario 1.

[SC of spreadsheet with detail.](https://imgur.com/a/TEUjadL)

Note, this isn't advice, just an illustration of what it means to continue to ""buy on the way down."" Your allocation should reflect your timeline and risk appetite.

As an investor in the AAPL stock, I was a bit concerned and wanted to check the article out.

The article mentions that ""Berkshire Hathaway sold some AAPL shares"". This made me actually go look at the form 13F to see what ""some"" means.  


In the Q4 2023 13F, Berkshire Hathaway owned 905,560,000 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012324002518-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q4-2023))

Why not implement a queue system for RTX 3080 sales?,"I worked at Apple for about 4 years between 2012-2016, and they gradually had a worsening scalper problem with new iPhone launches from iPhone 4 to iPhone 6S. The solution that they came up with was simple:

Regardless of whether the phones were in stock at the time, everyone who places an order gets a confirmation email and an ETA of their shipping time. Obviously the later you order the further down the queue you are and longer the ETA.

For example, if Nvidia had 10000 units of the RTX 3080 then the first 10000 orders would get a shipping ETA of 1-3 business days. Those who are the next batch would get an ETA of 1-2 weeks, then 3-4 weeks and so on (based on production volumes). 

This way staying up to wait for the launch will actually feel like a positive experience because at least you know you got the order in, and can get an estimate of when it will ship. Nvidia will also get money upfront (or at least credit card details if they want to be nice to the customers and not charge until shipping), and it will be harder for scalpers to sell to people who know they have cards on the way for MSRP. It‚Äôs a win-win situation. Nvidia can also take their time and manually review bulk scalper purchases while people wait patiently.

After Apple implemented this system for the iPhone 7 and later launches, the # of scalpers reduced drastically. Why don‚Äôt more companies do this?",4287

The real price of GME is currently around 900-1k RIGHT NOW BASED ON OBV,"FIRST OF ALL, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THESE ARE JUST MY OPINIONS AND INTERPRETATION. MATTER FACT, I AM JUST POSTING PICTURES OF CRAYON SCRIBBLES.

Since I can barely read/write myself, I'll keep this short and get straight to the point. There are way too many DD's out there, written by apes way wiser than me, with DETAILED explanations of everything I'm talking about. SUCH AS THIS SUPER IN-DEPTH DD REGARDING OBV IF ANY SMOOTH BRAINS WANNA DEVELOP A FEW WRINKLES BY u/Cuttingwater_ : [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdyfpc/gmes\_price\_continues\_to\_be\_artificially\_deflated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdyfpc/gmes_price_continues_to_be_artificially_deflated/)

For anyone else who's been here for while, we all know what the fuck OBV is at this point right?

HERE'S A QUICK SYNOPSIS:

All you need to know is that ""On Balance Volume (OBV)"" is a technical indicator that uses volume changes to make price predictions. This indicated is based on REAL data that has already happened, and therefore cannot be manipulated. It's literal purpose is to show how the price is moving. OBV TL;DR: **If the price closes higher than the previous price, OBV goes UP. If the price closes below the previous price, OBV goes DOWN.**

Now I'm a fucking illiterate, so naturally I am a visual learner. I've pulled the charts of a bunch of random ass stocks, including: AMC, APHA, APPL, CHWY, MVIS, PLTR, SNDL, TSLA, and WFC to compare and show how their OBV's trend according to the price moves.

The OBV for GME is absolutely artistic looking. As we all know, the price of GME is heavily manipulated. The OBV during January, specifically when the price was $482, the OBV was around **356.22 million**. The current OBV of GME is roughly **730.11 million**. And just doing a quick rough estimate with these numbers, based on percentage proportions, I believe that GME's current real price is actually somewhere between $800-1k.

TL;DR: OBV is generally used to confirm price moves, and is more than 2x the OBV in January's peak, which leads me to believe the suppressed REAL price of GME is currently somewhere between $800-1k.

I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING AND COULD BE MISUNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF OBV ENTIRELY. IF THAT'S THE CASE, PLEASE JUST FLAME THE FUCK OUT OF ME IMMEDIATELY. OTHERWISE...

I WANTED TO KEEP THIS POST AS BASIC AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AS POSSIBLE, BUT AS FELLOW APE u/Criand HAS SAID:

>OBV = OBV; if price stays the same

>OBV = OBV - Volume; if price goes down  
>  
>OBV on normal stocks will look roughly like the price chart. But GME is unique. We tend to have price go down significantly with little volume, but always price goes up with large volume days. You shouldn't see that. Large volume days should have some days where price drops, but that has yet to happen for gme.  
>  
>So now we see OBV continuing to rise, which screams manipulation. The true price should be following the obv more or less, resulting in OPs $900+

&#x200B;

My take from this is: despite there being a dip in AH, the OBV that is shown to still CURRENTLY higher be at a higher level than it was in January. Like I've said, I'm not sure what this all means, but I guess we can at least add this as another anomaly related to GME that doesn't occur it any other stock.

The View From The Other Side,"^(Disclaimer: This is strictly speculation. While I have a good understanding of markets - I've sat in a money market desk chair, I've traded + held swaps, managed a small bank's investment portfolio - I do not pretend to have factual knowledge about any specific positions held by any institution. I am also not any sort of big shot - my experiences are outside the US and in medium-small organizations. This isn't DD, since we're just making a guided tour of what's plausible, according to my experience. This is not a commentary on market structures or macroeconomics, as other users have far more insight (and more better words)) ^(than me. This is just a LARP of how I imagine a hypothetical scenario might have plausibly gone down. My experience is not in the US market, so that might introduce some errors. I might also just be plain mistaken, due to unknown unknowns, or being an idiot.  I welcome corrections. Through this scenario, ""we"" means this hypothetical institution, and not retail.))

Let's imagine we're a financial entity, with:

* market making privileges in equity, and a large market share of order processing, meaning we could, potentially, internalize demand as liabilities (IOUs/FTDs) or let them pass through to the market.
* with access to all standard products, meaning we're only limited by having to find a counterpart to any financial instrument we might want to use - even bespoke instruments.
* a big balance sheet.
* a large contact network, including political, enforcement and media.
* a widespread reputation of ""knowing what we're doing"" in a field in which very few people know what they're doing.

For some reason or another, we decide to short a stock - we're fairly confident that it'll go bankrupt. Why we are so confident is irrelevant - we just are. However, we're not really allowed - or it's suspicious, or just want to avoid the connection - to have a position in the securities we market-make, therefore we use our network of institutions to have a series of hedge funds - not us, but bound to us through shared ownership or debt or aligned incentives or whatever - hold the short positions for us. It's also possible that these hedge funds are taking this short position of their own volition, and we have nothing to do with it yet.

The point is, this specific stock has a growing short interest. It's easy to find the shares to borrow. All broker-held shares are kept within the DTCC books, that means they're all kept in a neat pile. We can borrow from the pile/warehouse and throw a few pennies back as fees. We then sell these stocks to retail, so the stocks end up right back on the borrowable pile - they never ""leave"" the brokerage, and the brokerage stores them in the same pile. We're adding a liability (the short stock) and an asset (the cash) on our sheet. They're fungible, and it's all happening in aggregate and behind closed doors, so nobody has actual proof - hell, nobody has reason to suspect in the first place, since the stock in question is a ""bad stock,"" according to the news, and so the collective meme says it should go down. Since each sold stock goes back to the pile, there's no shortage to the borrowable supply, and therefore no reason for the interest fee to go up. We can keep pointing at a share, using that share to create a liability, receive cash, and then point at the same share again. Also, if we occasionally/often fail to deliver/borrow, who's gonna notice, let alone stop us, right?

In essence:

* Customer bids/demands a share.
* The bid is routed to us by the broker.
* We grab a share from the borrowable pile - add this to liabilities. We add this same share to the customer's assets. We also take the customer's cash from their assets, and drop it in our assets.
* The customer's share is stored in the borrowable pile, thanks to the broker, so the pile's size hasn't changed.

**Result: Demand is satisfied. The borrow pile is unchanged. Our liabilities grow. Supply is not reduced. We took the customer's cash.**

We just need to be careful about the reporting methodology - make sure everything's tidy when the picture's taken, and as long as the pile is large enough relative to the daily volume, it's foolproof.

Fantastic, then. Each sale is free money, and the sold stock goes right back for-sale. Unnoticed, we're actually recycling the supply. The demand, on the other side, isn't - buyers need actual cash to buy, and that shit runs out. With endless supply and limited demand, the price goes down. Price going down should increase demand, but as long as the price is expected to continue going down, then that's neutered - people don't buy because the price is low, but because they expect it to rise. Besides, more demand means more sales, and more profit, yes? Eventually, we're confident the company will go bankrupt, and then we'll just be left with two piles: one of cash, and one of worthless liabilities, valued at 0. Pure profit, no need to even pay taxes, since we didn't really close our positions.

Then, two things happen. First, some schmuck begins actually looking at the numbers - ""bad stock"" meme isn't enough for him, and he realizes that the stock is too cheap, related to the fundamentals. He begins buying and spreading the word, which challenges our preferred meme. Suddenly, there's a narrative of counter-culture/resistance around buying the stock, it's seen as giving us the middle finger, and the kids think that's cool. Whatever, let's underestimate them. The second thing to happen, is that another guy - this one actually has three commas, so he's a bit more difficult to deal with - buys a bunch of the stock, and declares his intent to become an activist investor. He maneuvers intelligently, and before long, he's chairman of the board. While we're good at making memes for boomers, this dude is good at making internet-native memes, and he, without ever actually interacting directly with the community, manages to cement himself as a trustworthy, competent figure, opposed to wall street and internet savvy. He outlines a turnaround plan which actually - independently of everything else - makes sense, and he brings the drive and level of compromise a founder figure can provide, as opposed to distant institutional owners.

Now, a short position is a leveraged position, meaning we can be margin called if our unrealized losses exceed our collateral. Therefore, as the stock price stops going down, and begins going up, we have to begin to actually monitor the stock price and the short position size, versus the rest of our assets - and not all assets, but those considered high quality liquid assets, and therefore valid collateral. The way this works is, different asset types get assigned different weightings: the more liquid and risk-free the asset, the higher it counts. Cash is completely accounted, at 100%, but a risky bond might be counted at 10% only. Some assets might not count at all. The difference between the average short-sale price, and the current market price, multiplied by the short position size, can't exceed our high quality liquid assets, or we get a margin call.

`Liability: Current Market Price * Position Size, the value of the equities owed`

`Assets: Average Sold Price * Position Size, the cash we got for the sales`

Our collateral must be greater than the difference between these.

`(Average Sold Price - Current Market Price) * (Position Size) < = Value of HQLA`

Suddenly, demand - which has been growing steadily thus far - spikes. This has gone viral, and the transacted volume goes insane - way beyond what we can handle. The daily demand is bigger than the pile, so we're forced to let some of it through. Our methods had not been stress tested before, and thus we slipped. This means the price starts increasing, which fuels both more demand - from FOMO - and more supply - from people who consider the stock overvalued, and an easy short. The internal supply chains break, suddenly everyone's getting margin requirement notifications. The brokers don't necessarily know what's happening, all they know is that they sold a lot of the stock, and before they can turn around and buy it from us, the price has doubled - margin requirements go up! So, seeing this, trading is stopped at the broker level - they literally can't afford to owe any more shares. The apple store is out of apples. Close only. We, however, can keep selling, and we do. No new long positions, only new short positions - perfect, the price has to go down, regardless of the demand! The price falls down, the news spin this as a squeeze that's now over. 

The price falls all the way down to 40$, and then something breaks. Someone gets a margin requirement they can't meet, or someone places a buy order that's large enough, or something else happens, and forced buying begins, which again spikes the price. Liquidations are carried out, and at some point, these short positions end up in the market maker's books. While a hedge fund can get killed from such a spike, not us. We're a massive player, and we can sustain a lot more. We consolidate most of the short positions, to avoid any further melt-ups, and formulate an actual long-term strategy to get out of this mess. Melvin, Archegos, and others, are now dead, and we hold their books within ours.

Up to now, we've had to survive by using collateral against the short positions, which means that, at a certain point, we need to liquidate non-qualifying assets, and turn them into cash (or some other acceptable form of collateral.) Therefore, when the stock price rises, we need to sell our other positions, and turn them into cash. This explains the stock's negative beta: when its price rises, we sell other stocks to raise cash, which lowers their prices. When crypto is no longer acceptable collateral, we sell it for cash, and the price dumps around June. So, in essence, **the stock price has an inverse correlation to the price of anything else in our books that's not collateral.**

However, this isn't the best way to handle this - this is affecting the rest of our business, and won't work in a longer timeframe. Since we're a market maker, we don't really need to do the whole song and dance around borrowing shares, and holding collateral we can just directly create them as liabilities. This is the famous Fail to Deliver - they marked your assets and their liabilities, but that's it. Also, instead of being worried about collateral we're now worried about solvency.

We turn around to security based swaps/total return swaps. What are these? They're a piece of paper that's worth the difference between the values/returns of two securities. I can then replace the shorts vs. collateral method with swaps. No need to bother so much with high quality collateral, since whatever's on the other side of the swap essentially functions as collateral - I only need collateral for the difference. I can get a negative exposure on the stock price, against a positive exposure on the overall market. This way, if both go up together, then it makes no difference to me. Likewise if they both go down together. Any decrease in value from the movement of one is offset by the movement in the other. Let's assume our swap is done against a broad market basket and call it the counterweight (CW.) Now, instead of the stock and the market having an inverse correlation, they have a positive one. If the stock goes up 10%, then as long as the CW also goes up 10%, then the value of the swap hasn't changed. I don't have to massively sell anything, it's less suspicious, reporting rules are way more relaxed, the enforcement agency is much more, uh, amenable to my proposals. This works both for being long stock vs short market, or long market vs short stock - I can finetune my exposure both ways.

Importantly, what before were these counter-cyclical spikes, are now pro-cyclical. Has the stock gone up? Nah, it's the whole market, nothing suspicious! While before we counteracted the demand with short-selling, now we just fail to deliver - essentially neutralizing demand. Sure, that's even more troublesome, but nobody's ever paid any mind to Dr. Trimbath before, why would they start now? So if anyone buys the stock, we just add that to our liabilities, without it impacting actual market supply/demand. We can selectively decide to let some demand pass, in case we need to raise the price.

What this brings about, then, is a delicate balance:

* we can let demand for the stock reach the market, in which case the price increases.
* we can let demand for the stock go to our liabilities directly, in which case the price decreases.

Then, we can observe demand/supply, and have an algorithm decide which % of purchases to deliver. Monitor social media. Bullish sentiment? Sell them calls, and reduce the delivery % (let the spot purchases go directly to the balance sheet) - price doesn't rise. Bearish sentiment? Do the opposite.

If the stock's demand goes up, we can decide whether to lower the delivery %, through which we avoid a price increase, but in exchange become more levered. We want the price to be as high as possible, up to the point in which we get margin called - the ceiling. Therefore, we'll deliver as much as we can, and start FTDing when the price gets too high.

If the stock's demand goes down, we can decide to increase the delivery %, through which we lower our leverage, but in exchange the price doesn't go down. We don't want low prices: more people will buy, and we'll lower our average entry price. Therefore, we'll reduce leverage as much as we can. We might prefer to lower the price, but that'd depend on more meme-manipulative strategies, and not market-based ones.

Therefore, we observe demand + supply, and decide what % to internalize, and what % to externalize, thereby controlling the price. Depending on how big of an institution we are, we might be able to do the same, to a lesser extent, to the CW itself. Say, if we processed 70% of all orders, who's to say we can't nudge the S&P a bit, eh? Even if we can't, though, that's unimportant.

If the CW's price goes up, that gives us more breathing range. We can tolerate a higher ceiling stock price without danger, so we'll internalize less, reducing leverage, and increasing the price, until we reach the new, heightened ceiling.

If the CW's price goes down, that gives us less range. We can tolerate a lower ceiling high stock price or risk a margin call, so we'll have to internalize more, and become more levered, but lowering the stock price. Alternatively, we may choose to pump the CW - a couple million hitting the ask at the right moment should be enough.

We have, then, two variables of import:

* the CW's price, over which we may or may not have a degree of influence.
* the stock price, which results from demand, which we observe, and % of FTDs, which we control.

In this way, short selling is something we long stopped doing. Did the shorts close? Not really, but who cares. The question is whether we still have an exposure to the stock price, regardless of the mechanism.

Up to now we have a nice little model. It's not infallible: our control over the variables might not be perfect, and if demand doesn't stop we'll eventually be in trouble, but these dudes need to eat - wait long enough, and they'll get discouraged. A split, you say? The size of my liabilities hasn't changed. Yeah, they're 4 times as many stocks, but IDGAF about stock number - I care about the notional size of the position. ""In the shape of a stock dividend""? Yeah, nope. Spread some confusion about it. What can they do? Yeah, they'll seethe, but they've already been seething all along. If someone in an actual position of power comes around, we'll send some guys in suits to dazzle them with words. Who will they believe, the suits, or cherrypicked examples of particularly stupid apes? We like the chaos. The more chaos, the more tiring it is to find the truth, and the longer we can get away with shit. Unless the company withdraws from our system. In which case, I have no idea, because the debate shifts over to the legal battleground instead.

What else could threaten us? Well. You know what. DRS.

On one hand, if 100% of the shares are accounted for outside our system, then we're suddenly on the defensive. Now they don't really have to care about what we say the price is, do they? They could separate completely, accounting for all the shares, and trade within a separate system. What would we do with the deluge of DRS that'll hit? I have no idea, but it seems like the supply/demand equivalent of dividing by zero.

On the other hand, every share removed is, essentially, forcefully accounted demand. Say, you buy a share, I drop it on liabilities and FTD, and then you DRS it, then you're indirectly increasing leverage, since (total shares in books/actual shares in my vault, ""the ratio"") just got reduced by one on both the numerator and denominator. Do that enough times, and since the numerator is higher than the denominator, we're gradually increasing the ratio, which makes the effect of demand on price have a larger magnitude. How? Because the ratio is also the ratio in which I transform demand into either a price increase or leverage. When we turn demand into price increase  or leverage, the rate at which that happens is that ratio - the more we DRS, the higher the ""cost"" of turning demand into price or leverage. Meaning, the more we DRS, the more violent price changes will be, and the more magnified the leverage assumed will be. DRS 100%, and that rate becomes \[divides by zero.\]

Therefore, a separate market observer might want to consider two indicators as endgame conditions:

1. the DRS percentage + its rate of change, which can be proxied by the price of the stock, against some measure of how much free cash retail has, because this determines the speed of DRS. The lower the price, and the more available cash, the faster DRS will increase.
2. the price of the stock, against the CW (let's assume a broad market index of multiple asset classes.) If the stock outpaces the market, then we know the swaps are closer to breaking - this will have two possible effects:

* every time except the last, it will cause the stock price to go down, or the market prices to go up, to keep the swaps alive.
* eventually, the swaps will die, and then the stock will go up, and the CW go down, in a self-reinforcing de-leveraging.

What happens then? I dunno. I wouldn't want to find out, either. I'd take more and more risky moves. If at one point I'd have been careful about the legality of my moves, then by the end that wouldn't really matter much. Might even want to try to get political power to leverage that. After a certain point, the capital market problem spills over into the legal, social, memetic, political. Whoever's managing this shitshow hasn't slept well in a while, I can guarantee that.",5442

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that‚Äôs more likely to pull back.  It‚Äôs also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don‚Äôt do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it‚Äôs just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year‚Äôs worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don‚Äôt bet against this trend, it‚Äôs been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I‚Äôm dirt. 

Last year you couldn‚Äôt give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don‚Äôt overpay for the options, it works. I don‚Äôt like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I‚Äôm not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It‚Äôs hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don‚Äôt want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I‚Äôve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It‚Äôs also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It‚Äôs a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I‚Äôll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can‚Äôt mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I‚Äôve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack‚Äôs VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack‚Äôs VGM measures a stock‚Äôs value, growth rate, and momentum. It‚Äôs an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what‚Äôs new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don‚Äôt usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there‚Äôs any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it‚Äôs easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn‚Äôt ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven‚Äôt confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they‚Äôd have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn‚Äôt have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you‚Äôve invested actively for a while, you‚Äôve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I‚Äôve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What‚Äôs more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode‚Äù), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I‚Äôve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it‚Äôs likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it‚Äôs highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I‚Äôve been successful picking investments, I‚Äôve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We‚Äôve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That‚Äôs usually the moment I‚Äôve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn‚Äôt care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it‚Äôs likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there‚Äôs negative news driving this, I‚Äôm out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year‚Äôs returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should‚Äôve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don‚Äôt be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don‚Äôt chase the perfect trade. It‚Äôs a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn‚Äôt a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there‚Äôs more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",7874
A Guide On How To Buy A RTX 3080 - USA Edition,"It's been 3 months since the launch of the RTX 3080 and it ***STILL*** seems impossible secure (and don‚Äôt get me started about the scalpers). I spent a lot of time trying to get a RTX 3080 to complete my build, and I honestly thought about giving up.

After all my trial and error, I want to say it is **NOT** impossible. It has been starting to get a bit easier, but regardless of what people say, there are things you can do to increase your chances of success.

# Requirements:

* Computer
* iOS Device (Not needed, but helps)
* Understand the checkout quirks of each retailer (explained later)

# 1. Getting Alerts

The first part to getting an RTX graphics card is knowing when retailers restock. There are many servers / twitters that will send a notification when specific items come into stock. I'd recommend following them on Twitter and turning on notifications. Most of them who have been tracking NVIDIA RTX cards, have now started to track other hard to find tech items such as ZEN 3 and RX 6000 Big Navi cards.

# 2. Setting Up Settings

By default on a mobile device, apps will open links in the in app browser. Within the app settings change it to have links open in **Safari / disable in-app browser**. This will automatically open the Newegg / Amazon / Best Buy app when you click on a product link.

# 3. Setting Up Apple Pay Settings (If you have an iOS device)

Download the Newegg app, click on a random item, click the **Apple Pay button** on the bottom left and it should ask you to input your Shipping Information and Billing Information. Ensure you have those set up.

[Setting Up Apple Pay](https://preview.redd.it/p36gg3pvlx661.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=700180cfbfdc34efc42a626be195e023b2620b17)

# 4. Checkout Methods For Each Retailer

After trying my best to get a RTX 3080 on all retailers, I am going to discuss some tips on how to checkout with every retailer. Everything mentioned will apply to RTX cards, Big Navi and ZEN 3 as well. It‚Äôs not easy but it‚Äôs possible. You have to ensure you are either on your phone or computer when restocks happen immediately. A few seconds matters a lot (see the restock schedule later in the doc)

## Newegg

Newegg has been the easiest in my opinion, as they started to announce when they restock on Twitter. There are many different tips and tricks you can try on Newegg.

**Q: What is the the checkout method? (May not always work, explained later)**

1. Add all products you want to a wishlist
2. 30 seconds before a drop, start swiping down on the wishlist page (to refresh).
3. When the **ADD ALL TO CART** button turns yellow, hit it quickly and attempt to checkout.

**Q: Should I use Newegg.com or the Newegg mobile app?**

There have been many conflicting opinions with Apple Pay vs Computer on Newegg. I have seen the app fail many times, including the wishlist not refreshing anymore, so I would not recommend it every time.

From what I see, when Newegg ***announces a restock,*** I‚Äôd recommend to use the computer / Newegg.com to checkout. The app seems to fail when too many users are using the app.

**Q: How do I setup my Newegg.com account?**

Go to Newegg.com, add an item to cart, and go through the checkout process. When adding your address, I recommend clicking the dropdown.

If your account is configured correctly, it should only ask for your CVV **every time** you checkout.

**Q: What if they do not announce restock?**

If they do not announce restock and you get an alert for restock, I would recommend using **Apple Pay** and **Newegg app.** When alerts pop up, click the link to the product, and you will usually see the Apple Pay button on the bottom. Click on that IMMEDIATELY, and it will tell you to use face id or fingerprint. After authenticating, it will checkout immediately.

## Best Buy

Ensure you have an account setup on Best Buy with default shipping/billing/credit card setup. When Best Buy restocks, click the link and find the product YOU WANT. Best Buy only allows you to get one card at once.

With the new queue system, attempt to add to cart, but *ensure you stay on the screen*. You cannot navigate away.

[Please Wait](https://preview.redd.it/ttxqlxhxlx661.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32cf0fad7f229c57ada2962f26c441f50dff03a)

Eventually, the **Add To Cart** button will appear and you can add the item the cart. Checkout as fast as possible.

&#x200B;

[Add To Cart Button](https://preview.redd.it/98jh2rcylx661.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cfc12230ca09763883a3e424647c132f7b91838)

My recommendation would be to use an account on your computer, and a different account on your mobile device, because the queue system is random. It does not have a priority as to when you can add to cart. When it restocks, add the product on your computer, and another different one on your phone.

Whichever one comes first, attempt to checkout.

## Amazon

Amazon will restock a lot of products everyday, but likes to restock a very tiny amount each time, often less than 10 stock of each product at once.

The best way to get something off Amazon is to ensure you have your [1-Click Settings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201889370) configured. This will minimize clicking involved when you are on the checkout screen.

When a product is alerted for restock, I recommend **spamming** the Add To Cart button for a few minutes, as stock will sometimes will come in staggered. If the product adds to cart, immediately checkout as fast as possible.

[Amazon Add To Cart](https://preview.redd.it/ht71fxzzlx661.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fb18c483476da139c649876ffe4f4f399dbecc)

I found using the computer to be the best, but the mobile app can work as well.

## BHPhotovideo

Not many bots are after BHPhotovideo, so you have a good chance of getting on here if they restock. Just note, BHPhotovideo rarely restocks.

For the checkout process, just like other retailers, ensure you have an account setup ahead of time. I‚Äôve had good luck with Paypal, but both normal checkout or Paypal should work.

## Other Retailers

Of course there are other retailers such as ASUS, ZOTAC, Antonline, etc that release stock. The process is usually the same, ensure an account is setup beforehand, use autofill if possible, and pray you can checkout when it comes into stock!

# 5. When Do Retailers Restock?

After a month of logging when retailers restock, I have found a few patterns between some retailers. To increase your chances of success, make sure to be ready during these time windows (esp for Newegg):

* Newegg: Mon‚Äî Fri, most often on or near the dot. Either 4 PM, 5PM or 6 PM PST. I recommend following Newegg on Twitter as they seem to have tweeting out restock times. If there is no tweet, expect for restock around 4 - 6 PM PST.
* Best Buy: Generally drops every other week, usually Tues ‚Äî Fri, mostly in the morning, before 12 PM PST.
* Amazon: Random, will drop on weekdays/weekends at anytime.
* BHPhotovideo: Random, mostly weekdays, but weekend drops can happen.

**Good morning**

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

&#x200B;

Holy shit, you're not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD

&#x200B;

I told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of ‚ÄúBuy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally‚Äù Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that‚Äôs the gist of what happened this week, my friends. 

And you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I‚Äôm just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.

&#x200B;

[Others : White, Stock Market : Black](https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565)

I look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people's job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don‚Äôt. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.

So

A) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)

or just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.

In this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.

&#x200B;

**Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It‚Äôs just my own unique style of play.**

&#x200B;

So currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I'm gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long intro guys. I just had to let it out. Lets now decide what‚Äôs next. No need to rewind the massacre this week. We have it all covered in previous posts. For those of you who are new, i suggest reading these posts step by step. If not move on.

**Now moving on. Lets analyze the problem in the market.**

[Lets identify the problem.](https://preview.redd.it/6eiqjpx61uz81.jpg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b5cca7d3d29fffab91161a00ee9153c864d960c)

Disease : Bear market.

\-----------------------------

Bare minimum : Recession ( compare it with Oct 2008, 70s-80s period )

Mid : Forgotten Depression  ( 1921 )

Max Spread : Greater Depression  (1839, Oct 1929. Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )

\-----------------------------

Symptoms :

Downward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.

Worst performance of year since 1929 great depression.

Reacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.

\-----------------------------

Procedure :

God knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don't then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.

\-----------------------------

Medical Cure :

\- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)

\- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.

\- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)

\- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )

\-----------------------------

So we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says ""We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease"" This doesn't look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).

So we've got no choice other than to ""Swing trade"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment : Swing trade 2022**

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis :**

\- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022. Most probably 3rd week of september (Quadruple witching of the worst month) or Oct 24-27 (History of crashes) due to recession looming somewhere in 2022-23 ( yield curve inversion and first -ve quarter of GDP)

\- Inflation comes down without Volcker shock.

\- Expect 75bps and get 50bps in June-July FED meetings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 1 :** Look at the Nasdaq/QQQ  monthly chart and analyze it.

[Chart 1 : QQQ, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT \(O\)](https://preview.redd.it/yeuzcvz5lzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=efbf898f03e32971022aca9b37f5915cb8ebc708)

Chart 1 :

\- Stoch RSI bottom with numbers matching left and right. Meaning no significant down move possible with room for a slight leg up in the bottom, though ( like 2008 )

\- RSI has a history of bouncing b/w 40-45.

\- PVT(O) is already in the max pain accumulation zone. Meaning some big whales will be buying here.

&#x200B;

[Chart 2 : 2008](https://preview.redd.it/y892ntx5lzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=99a03969ffdd178ef2a356a7647c5e173e9cff6c)

[Chart 3 : 2022](https://preview.redd.it/pxr6bwz5lzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a6a736e34b52aa460f419b846503f59e30a33f0)

Chart 2 & 3 : Looking at 2008 and comparing with 2022. We have a lot of similarities

\- Two red candles and similar bar charts pattern.

\- Ketlner channel has a history of bounces from red zones.

\- Fib retracement bounce zone of 50% - 61.8%

\- 50wMMA is lying in the channel of fib and red zone.

&#x200B;

Result: Rally starts after June fomc. Two green strong months are coming. Est : July , August.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 2 :** Look at SPX/SPY monthly chart and analyze it.

[Chart 1 : SPY, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT\(O\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ajo8g3ymzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c36e599daab4afe868820d875360df2776812f2)

Chart 1 :

\- Stoch RSI bottom.

&#x200B;

\- RSI at 40-45 zone. Possible chances of bounce.

\- PVT(O) not full red. Meaning not many whales are accumulating right now.

&#x200B;

[Chart 2 : 2008 + 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ig1c3l3ymzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ce46ae8d2115f973980901d13337406f3b85459)

Chart 2 :

\- The 19-20% drop.

\- 50wMMA can come, but there is also a probability it won‚Äôt. But there is zero probability it goes straight down from here without an exit liquidity rally bounce of 2 months.

\- Ketlner red channel

&#x200B;

Result : Rally starts after June or July FOMC and gonna be volatile months. One green month is coming in August. Rally doesn't look strong in comparison to Nasdaq.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 3 :** Let's look at bonds

[Chart 1 : \(1950 - 2022\) Blue line : Bond yields , Orange line : Dow Jones , Blue line : Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/r3qgnk4lozz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1bd1e5ac4212f5814d07e1182240acaa6502a20)

Chart 1 :

\- Bond breakout is confirmed. Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.

\- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)

\- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.

Also, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it's all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.

&#x200B;

[Chart 2 : TLT](https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150)

Chart 2 :

\- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.

\- Let's look at some more technical stuff :

a) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )

b) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )

\- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.

&#x200B;

Result : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.

If inflation doesn‚Äôt come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 4 :** Let's look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.

[AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI](https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372)

4 things have been concerning me here :

\- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.

\- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.

\- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.

\- Apple's Q2 outlook wasn‚Äôt good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.

&#x200B;

Note : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 5 :** VIX & SKEW

[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6)

The VIX at 50, is coming this year.

If the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.

[SKEW](https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902)

Puts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.

Meaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 6 :** Housing Collapse

[Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d)

Many people were asking why am I saying that the ‚ÄúHousing Market‚Äù will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.

The absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn't do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.

**Step 7 :** So we talked about money and housing. Well then let's talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I‚Äôm not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.

[Wheat Futures \/ Average US median income](https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270)

What I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it's the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).

So what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn't start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let's bring this up to raise awareness among people.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

1. Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)
2. In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.
3. I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I‚Äôm just telling you what my charts tell me.
4. FED If - else statement

If

The FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)

(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)

Else

The FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.

(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)

&#x200B;

**Result :** 

Either way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.

&#x200B;

**Invalidation :**

Every theory and experiment has an invalidation case.

My theory has just 1.

If FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn't even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.

QE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.

QT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)

Hence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.

\- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don't let this fool you. I have told you in my previous posts investing in China/Hong Kong is better than investing in America going forward 10-30 years. Just look at charts of China CSI 300, Hang Seng and Nasdaq. This doesn't mean throwing all your money in. It just means having a % allocated to international funds.

&#x200B;

\- Powell came in and said :

Paul Volckering right now might be the right idea and could bring inflation down. But we dont know that yet and need more numbers (right now inflation is anchored and coming down in 5yr breakevens, but if it goes up sell everything and short or stay in cash)

Powell Earlier : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession and high employment.

Powell Now    : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession or high employment.

**The Moon to Mars and beyond.**

In the last week a lot has happened, so let me begin by stating, Thank you I appreciate the questions and I'm thankful to address this here and now.

In the last week we had a Hearing, we had our own LOTR; Return of the king, And Nasa landing on mars.

I'd like to personally thank Nasa on going ahead of the group in order to set up the welcoming committee.

&#x200B;

# The hearing Redux.

In the hearing we heard a lot, mostly how thankful Vlad can be, but also that Citadel and Melvin closed their positions on GME. In the days after the hearing it became evident due to the more astute retards on these boards that this was complete bullshit.I've been getting a lot DM's about this so let me address it here.See GME as apples, they bought apples, so normally in their books they should have apples written in right? But now they made fruit baskets, even though they just have the apples.But now instead of apples the books show fruit baskets.This is called creative bookkeeping or ""cooking the books""

Even though they still are short GME it just shows up differently, but at the end of the day nothing has changed. well except public perception perhaps.

# Robbing the Hood

So remember how Vlad said he was ""forced"" to close trading by the DTCC?Seems like Vladdy has been a naughty boy, he said that he was ""Forced"" to do so because he couldn't make the capital requirements.But a lot of people started questioning this from the get go, as we all thought there was more at hand, or at least more in the line of Collusion between the Hf's and Robinhood.

As the recent letter from the DTCC states

https://preview.redd.it/t2wp8wu4zzi61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=659c428d9bc2fd63ee7e5dc2f6b93ce3d891b239

So this was fixed before market open, so why where we not allowed to trade ?

seems like vladdy has some explaining to do.

# Catalysts

So the past week has been a long one. I mean holy shit a lot has happened right? We had a hearing of memes, DFV returning on screen, and for once we had the house committee on our side.

But most importantly when a representative asked if DFV would buy now at $45? our boy said a resounding yes.And guess what, the day after this motherfucking legend posted his update yolo once more.He has doubled his position. Take a moment and admire this mans amazing pair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also what's impressive to note is that u/deepfuckingvalue isn't the only one having a big pair this week. Apparently the Germans are coming through for us in the clutch, and not just any Germans.

But the German Bank Deutsche Bank invested in GME they bought 378823 stocks on 16/02/2021Edit: some users have pointed out that they bought these earlier, namely around Dec/ Jan, they need to report this within 45 days that's why it's showing up now.

Also Chamath Palipapitiya, who has been extremely outspoken about the short sellers and think what they are doing is illegal and should be put to jail, has posted yesterday.

This tweet like many others can be nothing, or he might have had enough of it and thought he'd finally get involved as he has often eluded to in recent interviews.

So it's fair to say, THE FIRE IS BACK BOYS!

We have seen such a huge change in mentality in the past week, it's beyond saying it's bullish, we are fired back up. I've seen so many people post great things this past week on how we are going to win again, the Fud has been lower and we are indeed going to get this sooner or later

# What the fuck is an exit strategy?

&#x200B;

So as the some may have seen we have had some weird posts in the past weeks, from full out ""false flag"" operations (shills) to ""Oh wE NeEd tO cLo$e AboVE 40"".The next one would most likely be ""oh when we reach X amount we need to sell"" or some shit like that.

Guys honestly relax, by the current estimates we are squeezing them so hard by the balls it's not just hurting them but any future grand children are going to feel this squeeze 40 years down the line.

1k is not a goal, it's a checkpoint, these guys need to buy the shares between 200 and 300% (as they have shorted it so much. and this is nothing more than supply and demand.

**We OWN the Supply, they have the demand for the stock.**

so WE set the price. and in doing so, 10k a stock is no longer a meme. As stated before in many threads they where greedy, and as long as we hold it can only skyrocket.

Good examples are exotic cars, while not all that special except for the brand name, a few brands own the complete market, thereby they are setting the price. If they would set it by quality of car or building costs we would have these cars at normal prices, but instead of that they OWN the market. Thus they set the price and we can't do shit about it.

Same go's for Melvin Citadel and the others.

They need our Banana Lambo's, we set the price.

# KFC Double Down

Extra tendie edition.

&#x200B;

Now there is also been some speech about ""Double down Monday"".

This originated most likely from the fact that DFV has doubled down. and I have to be honest  get it, I do. But realize that during the hearing Melvin or Citadel (can't remember which one I thought Melvin) spoke about making monitoring tools for reddit so they could keep an eye on future meme stocks. if they're keeping an eye out for that you can be certain that he has at least one person checking the relative boards for noteworthy content.

Now what's the problem with that you ask?

Well if we all agree to buy on Monday just to get a price spike, that is blatant market manipulation. This is the same reason you've not heard anyone speak of ""IF PRICE HITS X WE ALL SELL"". Because both these things are illegal.

**WE DO NOT DO AGREEMENTS ON WHEN TO BUY OR SELL!!!**

&#x200B;

I am personally getting more stocks today because I really like this stock and believe in the stock. if you'd like to get some stock today as well, please do so! Just don't post about agreements on times and dates, as making agreements related to stocks is still illegal. All I know is that I wont be selling bellow 10K.

# Important Dates

Now before we move to this one please note this is both important to know and not to get your hopes up. they can and most likely will try to kick the can down the road.

As some of you may have noticed the XRT ETF is now the target of shorting instead of only just GME. This is bad right?

**!!!NOPE!!!**

I see this as an absolute win!. You know why? Because the GME stock doesn't give dividends, you know which one DOES give Dividends? You guessed it XRT!

Now in laymen terms, with GME they would've just need to cover the interest rate of the borrowed stock. But with XRT it's the interest AND the Dividends plus an interest on the dividends.So this will cost them more money than if they just stuck with GME.

XRT releases dividends every 3 months. Last one was December 20th ,2020.Estimated next payout is around mid March. By all conservative estimates they have to cover before this or they will take immeasurable losses. What is also noteworthy is that XRT has 18k volume on 80$ Puts for 3/19. The volume for 3/26 80$ puts is 142. GameStop has thousands and thousands of 800$ calls for? 3/19.

this in combination with the earnings report coming out between the 20/25th this could be a date to keep an eye on. Because someone is expecting that the economy will totally crash, SPY XRT and GME.

And again you may think this is just conjecture and you'd be right. But I'm dumb enough to know I don't know everything, and smart enough to listen to people who do.

&#x200B;

Again none of this is financial advice, this is written by a moron who likes crayon soup.

again if I've missed anything please let me know and I'll add it in.

&#x200B;

Edit: changed the Deutchebank information

Edit 2: it's important to not forget that the hearings are far from over, and the representatives need to know what's going on, and Melvin/Citadel is trying really hard to keep this out.So it's important to write to your representatives.a template and what else to do can be found here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lp6phc/keep\_the\_pressure\_on\_your\_representatives\_in/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lp6phc/keep_the_pressure_on_your_representatives_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Nothing can keep tech stocks down as Apple and Amazon shine,,1
"Apple iPhone sales drop more than forecast, revenue falls for third straight quarter - Yahoo Finance","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-sales-drop-more-than-forecast-revenue-falls-for-third-straight-quarter-203804855.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-sales-drop-more-than-forecast-revenue-falls-for-third-straight-quarter-203804855.html) 

Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.  
  
On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.  
  
Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.  
  
Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.

PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm. Would love to see Apple making something similar. ",446

What the slide in sales of iPhones in China means for AAPL,"Apple has now fallen to the fourth best-selling brand in China, trailing behind Vivo, Huawei, and Honor after a 27% drop in iPhone sales during the first six weeks of 2024.  Meanwhile, Huawei's comeback, with a 64% sales increase over the same period might suggest that Apple is losing its appeal among Chinese consumers, who are increasingly returning to Huawei after it managed to overcome the US-imposed semiconductor restrictions to some extent. Question is, what does that mean for the AAPL stock? This [analysis implies that the markets are just down and that there haven't been many enough down days to suggest a bearish future](https://finbiteinsights.substack.com/p/stocks-down-but-not-bearish-yet).

Debating selling my Disney stock,"I've been holding DIS for a few years but I'm currently down 25% overall. The company isn't looking great right now - Bob Iger seems to be doing a terrible job, the content is stale (people aren't getting excited by Star Wars anymore and Marvel movies are flopping left right and center), and there's even rumors that Disney is going to sell their TV business soon. Adding the Hollywood strike on top of that, it just seems like a recipe for disaster. Should I cut my losses now and put the money into an index fund instead?

How do you guys deal with seeing big losses?,"I am a college student who recently decided to try my hand in the stock market. I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.

My question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?

Apple earnings are out ‚Äî here are the numbers,"Apple
 reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings: $1.88 vs. $1.94 expected
Revenue: $117.15B vs. $121.10B expected
Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:

iPhone revenue: $68.29 billion
iPad revenue: $7.76 billion
Mac revenue: $9.63 billion
Other products revenue: $15.23 billion
Services revenue: $20.67 billion
The primary focus for investors will be the company‚Äôs December quarter revenue. In November, Apple gave a rare warning explaining that production issues in China stemming from Covid restrictions would result in lower than anticipated shipments.

The data point caused many analysts covering the stock to slash their estimates.

Customers in many regions noticed that Apple shipping times for the high-end iPhone 14 Pro slipped past a month during the quarter, versus typical lead times of under a week, meaning that the premium iPhones were a tough Christmas present for people to get their hands on.

Now investors are looking for two answers on Thursday: How much did Apple sales really slip because of the production issue, and will people who missed out on an iPhone 14 Pro in December wait until 2023 to pick one up, which would effectively push sales from the 1st quarter into the 2nd quarter?

Investors may be able to get the answer to the second question from Apple‚Äôs guidance. Apple hasn‚Äôt given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty first caused by the pandemic. However, Apple management usually gives a few data points that give analysts a sense of how the quarter is going.

Analysts expect Apple to report $98 billion in sales in the March quarter, or slight year-over-year growth. If Apple‚Äôs data points suggest that it might come in under that figure, investors may question whether Apple can continue to outperform the market and whether waning consumer confidence may be starting to hurt its business.

The smartphone market and the PC market are both in the midst of a multiple-year slowdown, with sales falling in 2022. Analysts believe that Apple has done better than much of its competition even as shipments fall, but if consumer confidence is eroding, eventually sales of Apple‚Äôs premium-priced phones and computers will slow down.

Aside from hardware, Apple‚Äôs services business will be a focus after the bell. Several data points in the December quarter, including Apple‚Äôs own App Store payouts, suggest a slowdown in App Store growth. The App Store is one of the largest components in Apple‚Äôs services business, which is expected to total $20.67 billion in sales during the quarter, which would represent a nearly 6% growth rate.",599

   * Why are there two notification screens? ""Lockscreen"" and ""Notification center"". So many times I would think I've dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.
   * It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.
   * You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.
   * If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn't dismiss it from your notifications. I've already read it, why is it still in my notifications?
   * The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping ""by app"" in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc
* Gestures
   * You can only go ""back"" by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.
   * There is no dedicated ""back"" button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to ""swipe away"" this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.
* Home screen layout
   * Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it's such a pain in the ass. Why can't I hide apps or have an app drawer?
   * You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.
* Apps
   * Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is ""voluntary bloatware"". I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc
   * Can't set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit ""navigate"", and it opened Apple Maps. There's no way to change this behavior.
   * Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.
   * There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.
* Keyboards
   * I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.
   * If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no ""slide typing"" functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?
   * If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having ""2 apps for every app"" like I mentioned in the Apps section above.
* Camera/Photos
   * The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow
   * Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I've only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it's seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn't understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a ""live view"" of what the portrait shot will look like.
   * Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there's no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let's start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.
* Background processes
   * It's 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don't understand why.
* iMessage/FaceTime
   * FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I'm a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn't really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime's moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to ""reply to"" a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.

&#x200B;

The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.

I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won't or can't fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.",2370
How the coronvavirus stock-market rout left Chewy‚Äôs founder down $150 million on his Apple bet,,17
I sold all my Apple stock.,"I've been buying this stock all year ranging in price from $106 down to $90, average price of about $96.

I sold it all today. After analysis, I'm just not sure wtf this company is doing anymore. I've been a big fan of Apple since 2008 when I first bought my Macbook Pro, then iPhone, and pretty much everything after that.

This company is a shadow of its former self. Sure they generate tons of cash, but 90% of that is overseas. They are borrowing money to pay dividends. The company seems to get more loaded with debt by the year, which was never the case under Jobs.

I honestly don't like companies that buyback a ton of stock. This tells me Apple is out of ideas. Tim Cook is robbing this company blind.

They've been spending a fortune in R&D, yet all we have new under Tim Cook is a Watch that collects dust on the nightstand. Sure, they are looking into cars, but....cars???

The Mac line of computers never seem to get updated anymore, yet they'll release 3 iPad size versions and a couple of iPhone versions in a year. I just read a report that Mac sales are on a decline and they've lost what little market share they have, mostly due to the lack of upgrades to the hardware they used to be on the forefront on.

This combined with declining sales of their bread and butter iPhone? Yikes 

Judging by WWDC recently, Apple is truly out of ideas and lost its way. Stickers in the messaging app? Ok. Default apps would go a long way for me but whatever.

Plus, I have to wonder why the stock is so cheap. I've been picking it up all year as I've said, but I think investors realize there's no real future with this company anymore. They've got stagnant. I've owned the stock off and on since 2009 so I've made some gains, but I was hoping this round would be the last who-rah.

This stock has done nothing even in the face of the Brexit rally of the past couple of weeks. Zilch. No where. Sideways. Whatever you want to call it, Apple is lagging behind the market and I'm not just talking about the stock market.

The fundamentals of this company has drastically changed.

Perhaps...PERHAPS, once I see this stock in the low 80's and Apple shows some sign of innovation and a new product or two, that'll be the appropriate time to pick it up again.

But for now. I'm out. Good luck to whoever took my trade at $97.40.",487

"Chegg's stock falls 50% due to ChatGPT's impact, even after they announced their own AI chatbot. My breakdown on why this matters.","The news that Chegg stock dropped nearly 50% in a single day after the earnings call caught my attention. Then as I dove in, I began to realize there was a deeper nuance many mainstream media articles weren't capturing.

**This is also an excellent business case study in how to shave billions off your market cap when you think your own AI tool is enough to defend your core business.**

[Full analysis here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/cheggs-stock-tumble-serves-as-wake-up-call-on-the-perils-of-ai), but key points are below for discussion.  


* **Chegg had actually called out ChatGPT as a threat in their February earnings call.** And to stay ahead of the ball, they announced CheggMate, their own GPT-4 powered chatbot, last month.  

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

I recommend you start this DD by playing this song. It makes me bullish, maybe it'll make you too, [Youtube - Waiting All Night by Sikdope](https://youtu.be/nWAFe8oTVgQ)

[Four 240mg energy drinks and a lot of water this time!](https://preview.redd.it/4d8uatkru4191.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec67b6359afd0d6eacd95936a180df847f23ba6e)

If you haven't read my [The Shrinking Exit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/urmh05/the_shrinking_exit_gme_at_a_major_turning_point/) DD, please do, this topic will make more sense. However, I will recap some of it here.

Public short interest is close to being overshadowed by GME DRS ownership. This will be a **major turning point**, as those who publicly shorting GME will be **outnumbered** by those who hodl through DRS.

DRS is **shrinking** the **free float** (publicly tradable shares), shrinking the metaphorical door the hidden shorts must exit through. More apes with diamond hands are choosing to DRS which is slamming the door shut.

[Raise your pirate flags, because I'm not leaving. Are you?](https://i.redd.it/56ku8c90v4191.gif)

Currently, GME's short interest has been hidden through manipulation (ie. swaps). We don't know exactly how many there are, but we can calculate how much room they will have to exit.

To understand what exit they have to close with, let's break down how the free float is calculated, why it's ridiculously tiny, and how ill-liquid the stock has become.

Before we go anywhere, here is a lingo explanation graphic for new apes!

https://preview.redd.it/4shfsyl3v4191.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b55a90e1d1cc7c89e98e9a33ca466f1a403414

Now that you're caught up. Let me explain the current Free Float by comparing GME with Apple.

[GameStop vs Apple free float comparison.](https://preview.redd.it/uy8ns7b5v4191.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a7cd4541b860171c4dfc6dc12fa2c32b13f3d5)

# What does this mean?

GME's is ridiculously free float is ridiculously small, as DRS continues to grow, in-turn the free float will continue to shrink. The shorts MUST close and this is their only exit.

# GME's Current Free Float/Full Float

* **76,339,024 outstanding shares** aka all shares in existence
* 76,339,024 - 13,232,080 insider shares =  **63,106,944 non-restricted shares**
* 63,106,944 - 12,887,912 DIAMOND HANDED DRS shares =  **50,219,032 shares in the ""Full Float""**
* 50,219,032 - 28,413,271 shares from institutions, mutual funds, ETFs, etc =  **21,805,761 shares in the ""Free Float""**
   * It's important to know that these institutions can and will paper-hand their shares early. However, the estimated 'Free Float' numbers here are probably the same numbers the shorts will be using.

On paper, only 28.56% **of GME shares are publicly available to buy**. THIS THE THE MAX THE EXIT CAN BE!

As in **71.43%** of the company is being held PUBLICLY! ON PAPER

Everything else has been carved out.

# Fun Fact: GME's insider ownership is 288x of Apple's

* Hat's off to Ryan Cohen and the team for **owning and believing in their own company,** more than Apple's CEO, board, and executives believe in theirs.

# GME's free float is MINUSCULE when compared to Apple.

* Shares of Apple that are publicly tradable are **16 BILLION SHARES** or **99.94%** of all shares.
* Shares of GameStop calculated to be publicly tradable is **21 MILLION SHARES** or **16.84%** of all shares.

This **doesn't** even include apes who are holding in **brokers** and **IRAs**! As each individual decides to DRS, they further shrink the public numbers of available shares. So by including non-DRS the publicly available shares must be significantly less than the infographic above. Now compared to Apple, GameStop's float has much less liquidity. This is the tide pulling back before the tsunami.

# The less liquid, the faster and higher GME flies.

Now, what if I told you, the are scenarios where the free float can be **even smaller**?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/viuwz6i9v4191.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=54a68462552370e8288f0f5b1b9b0f5c67bdd588

# These are possible scenarios that will DECIMATE the free float.

[This breakdown of each section of the company estimates a possible exit free float size that the hidden \(through manipulation, swaps, etc\) short positions must close through. Breakdown is vertical, read top to bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/go8u6jkav4191.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1852b96f559c672ff31cc6e97168cfdd3652302)

These two estimates show how the door is on the edge of closing shut.

* Hypothetical Exit Size 1: **10.87% -** scenario if all public shorts close their positions.
   * A catalyst could cause a domino effect, with public retail shorts and small short hedge funds closing their short positions, increasing the price, leading to more shorts closing. Once these public shorts have closed, there is only a **10.87% free float or 8.3 million shares** to close their positions with.
   * TLDA: If all public shorts cover, hidden shorts have 8.3 million shares as their exit.
* Hypothetical Exit Size 2: **0.26%** **-** scenario if all shares on loan are recalled.
   * A share recall or all institutions recalling their shares would lead to all shares on loan to be returned. Short sellers have sold those shares, so now they must go out on the open market and buy them back. Once this occurs, the available shares to buy from the free float becomes **0.26% or 200,389 shares** to close their positions with.
   * TLDA: If all shares on loan are recalled, hidden shorts have 200,389 shares as their exit.

# THIS IS CRAZY.

That means if these events were to occur, the company will publicly be OUT OF SHARES. Which means in order to shake shares out of retail, they must increase the price they are willing to buy at. If no one sells as the rocket begins to fly, then the flight will be **destined for the moon and beyond**.

Once the rocket takes off, the shorts will be forced to buy our shares **AT ANY PRICE**.

# THE EXIT IS SHRINKING.

The GME story has brought us right here, right now. Where the exits are undeniably tiny, and the rocket is set to fly.

Diamond hands have bought every dip and locked them away in DRS. Those DRS numbers publicly show undying support for GameStop, GMErica, and the NFT marketplace.

GameStop's extremely resilient hodlers have shrunk the possible exit through the free float to LESS THAN A PERCENT.  AND it's even possible these scenarios could occur at the same time!

# Victory is in view. So what now?

# Let's look to the VW to understand ""how to short squeeze""

Let's get this part started by watching this clip of the [Volkswagen Short Squeeze in 2008](https://youtu.be/S93tMWka9-4). *(2 Min)*

It's **HYPE**. Worth every second.

CNBC Reporter Linda Behringer says Porsche announced ownership in VW...

* ""They (Porsche) hold **42.6%** in Volkswagen currently (**shares**), and another **31.5% via options**. So indirectly Porsche owns nearly 75%""
* ""Effectively, there's only a **tiny free float** left of just **under 5.7%**""
   * Compared to the **10.87%** and **0.26%** scenarios, GME is looking juicy.

# She states that the VW squeeze must have occurred due to the massive share and options buying

*Side Note: What Charles Gradante said about the buy button has been accounted for by Retail. Apes have switched brokers and diversified. Get countered hedgies. Back on topic...*

Charles Gradante states three main points about the 'Sneeze'...

1. How Market Makers (Citadel) take on short positions via **shorting calls**
2. How (1.) can lead to **hedging**, causing the **stock's price to go up**
3. How the buy button was turned **OFF** for everyone EXCEPT **short sellers**

Understanding how these two videos connect is the ***key*** **to** **finally locking the float**.

# Retail needs BOTH shares and options.

I think it's as simple as that, VW needed **both** to squeeze, and **options lead to hedging** which **forces market makers to buy shares**.

[\\""Brick by Brick\\"" - Ryan 'Freakin' Cohen](https://preview.redd.it/ay6iovsnv4191.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc27bd1376daad3a693892de0c20c019c5c9ae13)

These videos have been circulating since last year! It's been in front of us the whole time!

I think the topic of **hedging** via market makers buying shares for their short positions against calls, is very important. It's important enough that if that last sentence sounded like gibberish, then I've got something for you.

# So let's break Hedging down ~visually~

*Also! Are you ready for another bullish song?* [*Youtube - Momentum by Don Diablo*](https://youtu.be/cZHzxF0YUeU)

https://preview.redd.it/tsd81bqqv4191.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=299350e915bec2d4820ae7a6d53b066b340bc87a

The options market is confusing on purpose, but let me try and break it down.

[Market Makers will pair off or 'marry' two sides of an options trade. The long trader buys a call aka a bet the stock price will go up. The Short trader is short the call aka betting the stock price will go down.](https://i.redd.it/u1nmunsyv4191.gif)

[With high call volume, there are no shorts to take the other side of the trade. Therefore, the market maker is forced to take the short position against it.](https://i.redd.it/42vraky5w4191.gif)

[When a market maker takes on a short position, like shorting a call, they must decide to hedge or not. Hedging a short requires buying the underlying stock. If they chose to do nothing, then if the call is exercised they still must go buy those shares to fulfill those shares.](https://i.redd.it/qvfwyl7aw4191.gif)

[Hedging by buying the underlying stock increases the price of the stock. Hedging = Price go Up.](https://i.redd.it/j8rz4k0hw4191.gif)

When call options **overwhelm** the Shorts, hedging leads to a **self-feeding loop** that results in the price movement seen in January 2021.

1. Excessive Call options are bought by retail
2. Market Makers start to hedge calls that they think might be exercised
3. Hedging means buying the stock, which increases the price.
4. More calls go in the money and must be hedged.
5. Hedging leads to MMs buying more of the stock AT ANY PRICE, bleeding their available capital.
6. Repeat Steps 2-5 for EXPLOSIVE EFFECT.

# So hedging is powerful, but I thought ""options are FUD""?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0td9p8skw4191.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a07eeb94f5ad98529e194d7fbc3ffdd27deee4

# When I start this part, I want to clarify, DO NOT GO BUY OPTIONS. I AM PROMOTING DISCUSSION IF THEY ARE IN RETAIL'S BEST INTEREST. THIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED !!

**Edit: A commenter suggested that Superstonk DOESN'T NEED TO BUY ANY OPTIONS. THE GAMBLING SUB WILL BUY IT FOR US, RIDING THE DRS WAVE.**

**Hedging screwed the Market Makers** enough last January that they turned off the buy button to stop its exponential growth. That hedging cycle of growth was generated by **excessive call options**.

This is where I have concluded that **""Options are FUD"" is FUD**.

* Options are simply a way to **buy shares** at a later date.
   * **With GME, they are just future discounted shares.**
* An option can be bought for cheaper than shares.
   * The leverage is like a damage multiplier, forcing hedging of more shares than could be purchased.
   * Note: BUY, HODL, VOTE, DRS is the way. I'm not saying buy options instead of getting shares, which you should buy right now and through IEX.
* By buying options **EXPLICITLY TO EXERCISE,** can force 100s of shares to be bought by shorts, whenever you want.

The reasons why Options got a bad name

* Retail using them as lottery tickets
   * Lottery tickets like a week until they expire at ridiculous strike prices
   * Lottery tickets are rarely exercised.
   * This is how Hedge Fund have been bleeding retail's money.
* Retail not exercising their contracts and selling them
   * This drops the important hedge that was described earlier.
   * MM will drop those shares on the market, lowering the leverage against them.

# Options should be regarded as another tool in retail's belt.

# GME is steps away from all systems go!

* Each day more shares are DRS'ed and pulled from the corrupt system.
* This shrinks the free float even further, closing the door shorts have to close with.
* At any moment Catalysts can occur like
   * NFT Marketplace launch
   * 'For' vote passing, resulting in an immediate Stock Split,
      * Could result in a Share Recall
   * Increased Insider buying, like Ryan Cohen increasing his stake
   * Public shorts start covering
* Catalysts can result in
   * Overwhelming **share buying** routed through IEX, can overpower daily short volume.
   * Overwhelming **call options** can lead to Market Maker hedging, an endless loop of buying the stock.

# Overwhelming the system, can trigger MOASS.

# BUY, HODL, DRS, VOTE.

That's all I got for today. Thanks for reading!

I follow a bunch of people on Twitter and it seems everyone‚Äôs crazy about SCHD and JEPI right now‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve heard DGRO is a better long-term choice than SCHD and JEPI(?).

And then there is HNDL, which offers a 7% annual distribution and likely to appreciate significantly once interest rates come down due to its extensive bond portfolio (55%)‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know where to start to be honest‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also come across ATRFX this week, which seems like a great strategy (up 25% YTD), but the expense ratio seems a bit high? I guess my question is‚Ä¶

1. How much money should we keep in Apple stock?
2. Do DGRO, HNDL, and ATRFX sound like good choices?
3. Any other ETFs you can think of that you‚Äôd recommend?",123
Take Your Profits and Run! AI Hype Is DONE,"Many companies have spoken about AI and how they will incorporate it into their products and services. Including Apple, where they revealed information about their AI iPhone and their stock ripped from $190 to $220 a share on this news. People are acting like the .com bubble but with AI, any major company that mentions ‚ÄúAI‚Äù their stocks get rewarded. However, this is not justified IMO because as of right now, I have not heard how AI will generate more revenue but only how it will make things more efficient/convenient for their customers. Just like with Apple, there was no mention of how they will profit from AI, and all of the features they mentioned are cool but not to the point where people want to go out and buy the new iPhone because of it. Just like in the .com era, mentioning you have a website was all you needed to say as a company for your stock to be rewarded. Even now companies are not laying out a clear plan on how they will generate this increase in revenue that people assume will come with AI and that is priced in. AI is just going to be another tool companies use to cut costs and stay competitive, and once the hype slows down and the market opens its eyes to this simple fact, we could see a correction.",0
What are your ‚Äúthey‚Äôll be back‚Äù stocks?,"Excluding blue chips like Apple and Microsoft, what companies do you believe will best weather the storm and likely be back to where they were before the pandemic.

Are you worried about the US having a more productive economy compared to Europe?,"I have been researching the topic of why Europe lacks big tech companies (apple, google, etc) while America has many of them. It seems that difference comes down to the US having less regulations around companies. The GDP and GDP Per Capita of America is higher than European countries because US companies are more economically productive. Lastly, all of that is reflected in American stocks having higher returns (10%) compared European stocks (5%). 

So in terms of future prospects for Europe, are you worried that European countries have let the technological revolution pass them by without benefiting from it by having big tech companies? Should one worry about their own ability to a have a prosperous life in Europe when the continent is lagging behind America in economic productivity?",46

Car Wars Episode EV - A CANOO Hope - Why $GOEV can be a tremendous play for both long and short term gains.,"**TL;DR** -  HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS, LOW FLOAT, HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK, RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS

Hello degenerates, 

I like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. 

**LET'S START WITH THE BASICS** 

Canoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. 

**Let's talk shorts**

The current float available to short is **0.15%**, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up:

**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**

High short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV)

Low float: Yes, total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)

Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link,](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch) marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev)

High short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn‚Äôt be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) Nasdaq 11.3 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)

**Other points of interest**

6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks.

6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. 


**Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering.**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so, what about the long-term? 

Besides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a **VERY** bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 **NEW** institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. 

**The Covid Killer Car** [Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology), their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with **INNOVATIVE TECH** the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. 

The juicy **speculative rumors**  - **Apple Partnership** - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. 


**SEC investigation** - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. 

The Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value. I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip, my position is shares and calls bought @~9.60.

**edit 2: I may make a new thread later but I'll keep some news added here as well**

I am still in and like how the stock is moving, [this article here shuts down some of these apple purchase rumors, albeit not the purchasing of certain IPs and product designs, but is extremely bullish on the stock as a growth stock.](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/06/apple-wont-buy-canoo-but-you-should-still-buy-goev-stock/)

Dividends are the end game.,"Profitable? Done. Now the goal is profits every quarter, amongst other requirements, so that GME can join the S&P500.


The end game? Dividends


Companies pay their executives in shares. GME is no different. The executives get minimal base pay, $150k-250k. They get paid $5-15 Million in GME shares. Most executives of profitable companies don't sell their shares. It doesn't make sense, when they know the share price will continue rising over the years.


They know a dividend will be paid out on those shares. That's how they get paid. If you worked for an S&P500 company, eg Apple, you would not sell your shares as soon as they vest. You know in the future the price of those shares will be worth more, and you would get paid a dividend from Apple on top of it.


Once a stock pays dividends everyone rushes to buy it. Everyone here also knows that shorts must pay the dividends on shares they sold short.


Using simplified rounded math for examples sake. GME has 300M shares outstanding. If they paid a yearly dividend of $1 a share, they would, from their profits, be paying out $300 million a year in dividends. This is reasonable.


If you are short 100-300% of the GME float, that would cost you anywhere from 300-900 million a year just in dividends to keep your shorts open. You will bleed millions and billions every year just to remain short. I'll wait, and I'll keep buying that dip and averaging down. I've been doing that for the past 2 years.


MayoMan, do you know what the GME holders are going to do with that 300-900 million of your cash? They're going to buy more GME with it. They're going to use your money to buy GME. A billion dollars of buying will surely raise the price. So you'll have to continue to short it, doubling down on your losing position, and bleeding even more in dividends payments. You will repeat this until you are bankrupt. Of course, covering now bankrupts you anyway, so you have no choice but to buy 'one more day'. It's the smart move. I don't blame you.




They said GME was going bankrupt. Not happening.

They said GME wouldn't turn a profit. They did.

They think GME won't turn a yearly profit. <- You are here.

They think GME won't join the S&P 500.

They think GME won't pay dividends.




Meanwhile I will buy more and DRS. Oh, by the way, did you know that SuperStonk will own more than 50% of GME soon? This means they can, through a shareholder proposal, ask for a dividend.


Buy. Hold. DRS.

None of this is financial advice...",3722
Amazon drops 137 billion in marketcap - a record.,"Amazon drops 7.5% today after earnings, losing 137.25 billion in one day. This is the biggest marketcap drop in one day. To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.3% in sp500, 0.63% in QQQ, 1.65% for consumer disc sector. The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household.

 Only 98 companies worldwide (of which 59 is us) have a marketcap of 137 billion+. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, previous miss was in October 2018, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash. Also jeff bezos fell to 2nd richest after today's drop.

In my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. If i would break down segments by importance it would be: 40% aws, 25% ads/other, 35% store. I think the aws/ads accelerating would increase stock price so if store was its own company, it would be a 22.5% drop. this drop is unjustified. I would consider to buy this stock but im more of an etf guy, so i dont have a position.

Keep in Mind they're all Top Holdings of Citadel, SUSquehanna & Company. LETS DIG DEEPER!","A User recently requested I post this here as Kenny & Company seem to be Commencing The Bag Pass!

While Most The World is Asleep Apes are Paying Attention!

Working on a In Depth DD regarding Griffin-Madoff Connection.

Should have up Tomorrow or Next Day!

So recently saw a New Forget GameStop Article...

Wanted to Break It Down!

[ Sureeeeee](https://preview.redd.it/1vz3yjqwliac1.png?width=1467&format=png&auto=webp&s=31692d46138d0bd086669abdb8e9143609040698)

Keep in mind most PFOF Brokers that Receive Revenue from Citadel, SUSquehanna & Company Suspended GameStop & Movie Stock....

For Example Robinhood made over 77% of its TOTAL REVENUE in 2021 (Year of Sneeze) from Citadel, SUSquehanna & Company....

Citadel & SUSquehanna pay 1st and 2nd Most for PFOF from Brokers....

Keep in mind Jeff Yass of SUSquehanna was absent from The GameStop Hearing!

Will get back to Robinhood shortly in this DD. Stay Tuned!

So first off so this makes a little more sense lets look at Citadel & SUSquehanna's Top Holdings...

[Citadel Top Hodlings](https://preview.redd.it/61j7aqryliac1.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac107d48c8271c90611287ee0380a75b0a0b201)

Keep in mind Venator Materials PLC (VNTRF) which is an OTC Stock and Top 10 Holding of Citadel was acquired by them THE DAY BEFORE IT PUMPED AND DUMPED!

They acquired more VNTRF Stock than the FLOAT!

Now lets looking SUSquehanna's 13F.... Pretty similar to Citadel minus OTC Pump and Dump...

[ SUSquehanna Top Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/apcgwom1miac1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=079a12d35f7f1abef9f1695e6439dd16adfd95d5)

Wanted to focus on some of the Top 10 Stocks they claim Bets Sub buying that stick out...

Sounds like Bag Passing to Me? You be the Judge!

First one that stood out to me would be Lululemon....

As mentioned in the Article Viking Global is a Large Investor...

AMD Puts and Calls is a Top 35 Holding of Citadel and Top 50 Holding of SUSquehanna....

Here is where Things Get Interesting as I mentioned I would get back to Robinhood....

So during the time of the Sneeze Virtu asked Robinhood to route away all trades beginning with the letter ""A""... Except (Apple, Amazon & AMD)... Hmm why keep the ""Blue Chips""?

Keep in mind Apple, Amazon & AMD are Main Derivatives used by Citadel, SUSquehanna & Company that they have ""Puts"" and ""Calls"" in as seen above....

Keep in mind Robinhood Restricted 5 Stocks with the Letter A... AMD is the only ""Blue Chip""..

American Airlines and Movie Stock were in the Original 13 Suspended by Robinhood...

Keep in mind Citron Research put out a Similar Tweet as GameStop regarding American Airlines!

"Snap‚Äôs Financial Update Was So Bad, Facebook and Twitter Stocks Are Falling, Too","Snap stock plunged in late trading Thursday after the social-networking firm posted disappointing revenue growth and guidance that fell shy of estimates. The parent of Snapchat said its advertising revenue was hurt more than expected by Apple ‚Äòs change in the rules surrounding advertising on mobile apps. The miss weighed heavy on shares of other major social-media companies. Snap (ticker: SNAP) stock was down 21% in premarket trading Friday. Facebook (FB) was down 3.9% on the news, while Twitter (TWTR) was off 4.5%, Pinterest (PINS) had fallen 2.6%, and Alphabet (GOOGL) had slipped 1.8%. Snap is the first of the companies to report September quarter results.

For the third quarter, Snap posted revenue of $1.067 billion, up 57% from a year ago, and below the company‚Äôs guidance range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion. Adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, was $174 million, well above its guidance range of $110 million to $120 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company earned 17 cents a share in the quarter, beating the Street consensus of 8 cents a share. The company said it grew daily average users in the quarter by more than 20% to 306 million.

For the fourth quarter, Snap is projecting revenue of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion, well shy of the Street consensus forecast of $1.36 billion. Snap is projecting adjusted Ebitda for the quarter of between $135 million and $175 million.

Snap blamed the miss in part on changes in Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) advertising tracking practices that make it harder to track consumer behavior across apps and websites. ‚ÄúOur advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple in June and July,‚Äù the company said in remarks prepared for the company‚Äôs earnings conference call. ‚ÄúWhile we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS.‚Äù Snap said the issue ‚Äúwas compounded by the ongoing macroeconomic effects of the global pandemic, with our advertising partners facing a variety of supply-chain interruptions and labor shortages.‚Äù The company said that factor reduced the ‚Äúshort-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply-constrained.‚Äù

Snap added that Apple‚Äôs changes have ‚Äúupended many of the industry norms and advertiser behaviors that were built on IDFA, Apple‚Äôs unique device identifier for advertising, over the past decade, which now require a double opt-in by users in order to access directly.‚Äù The company noted that Apple has rolled out a proprietary solution known as SKAdNetwork, or SKAN, to allow app-based advertisers to continue measuring their advertising on iOS. But it says results have been disappointing. ‚ÄúThe initial results we observed using SKAN were generally aligned with prior industry-standard solutions, and we were among the first platforms to lean into this solution and push for widespread industry adoption,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúHowever, over time, we saw SKAN measurement results diverge meaningfully from the results we observed on other first- and third-party measurement solutions, making SKAN unreliable as a standalone measurement solution.‚Äù

*Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs stock fell 10% to $8.61, storming toward its lowest closing share price since WarnerMedia and Discovery began trading as one entity in April 2022 upon the completion of their merger.*

*The downswing came after Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings report released Friday morning revealed $10.28 billion in fourth-quarter revenue and a $0.16 loss per share, both well worse than consensus analyst estimates of $10.34 billion in sales and a $0.10 loss per share, according to FactSet.*

*The double earnings miss clouded the fact that Warner Bros. Discovery notched a $103 million profit in its direct-to-consumer division encompassing its Max streaming service, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), an impressive feat considering competitors like Disney and Paramount have never sniffed a year in the black.*

*But even Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs silver lining didn‚Äôt have much luster: Its direct-to-consumer unit‚Äôs $55 million loss last quarter fell far short of analyst forecasts of a $20 million profit.*

***Crucial Quote:***

*Even Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels seemingly downplayed the notability of his company‚Äôs streaming accomplishment. ‚ÄúWe will not be focused so much on individual quarters‚Äô or years‚Äô profitability‚Äù in the direct-to-consumer business, Wiedenfels said during Friday‚Äôs earnings call, noting the segment‚Äôs ‚Äútop priority‚Äù is to ‚Äúfuel‚Äù broader growth.*

***Key Background:***

\*Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs valuation has cratered from over $60 billion in April 2022 to $21 billion. The decline coincided with the market‚Äôs broader chilliness toward media stocks as companies struggled to translate rapid subscriber growth to profitability. Shares of Disney+ and Hulu parent Disney are down about 50% from their 2021 peak and shares of CBS and Paramount+ parent Paramount are down roughly 90% from their 2021 high. Disney reported a $*~~2.5 billion~~* ***$134 million*** *loss in its direct-to-consumer streaming unit last quarter, Paramount tallied a $238 million loss and Comcast suffered a $825 million loss for Peacock, which accounts for a far smaller portion of Comcast‚Äôs broader business than Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs, Paramount‚Äôs and Disney‚Äôs services. The digital native Netflix has long turned a profit in streaming, raking in $1.7 billion of EBITDA in its most recent quarter. Amazon and Apple do not report detailed financials for their respective streaming units.*

***Surprising Fact:***

*Friday is technically the lowest adjusted share price for Warner Bros. Discovery since 2009, if you include Discovery‚Äôs history as a separate, publicly traded company from 2009 to 2022, though it‚Äôs an uneven comparison considering the 2022 integration of WarnerMedia and its associated debts.*

I am now going to shirt NVDA stock.,"I have been investing in NVDA since 2017, and it been wonders. I've just finished selling all of my NVDA stocks today, and made over $800,000 from this one stock alone.

  
However, enough is enough. 

Today I am shorting the stock. It cannot keep going up. I mean its worth more than APPL now seriously?

The average person wouldn't have a single NVIDA product except maybe 1 or 2 GPU's in some of their devices they are unaware about.

But every household has heaps of Apple products.

  
After careful analysis, I am predicting NVDA will go down to $750.

TIFU by downing 2 litres of apple juice and not appreciating the effect this has on the human bowel...,"Obligatory throwaway account and this actually happened earlier this week.

&#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom. 

&#x200B;

My job is driving around shops and putting out displays, leaflets, POS etc. I had one particular call that involved moving lots of heavy stock and building some massive displays. 2 hours of very heavy manual labour left me literally dripping in sweat and craving a nice cool, refreshing drink. Before leaving the shop, I went to the fruit juice chiller. ¬£1 for 1 litre of apple juice, or ¬£1.50 for 2 litres. I love apple juice so I'll take the 2 litres please.

&#x200B;

I drank the first litre in the 2 minute walk back to my car as I was incredibly thirsty. My next store was about 45 mins away so get in my car and crank up the air con.

&#x200B;

Drink the second litre of apple juice within the first five minutes of my drive and start to feel refreshed so stuck on a podcast and settled in for the drive.

&#x200B;

15 minutes until the end of my drive and I start to get a bit of cramping in my stomach. Think to myself that I'll use the bathroom at my next store.

&#x200B;

10 minutes until the end of my drive and the cramps are getting worse. Do a little lean to the side and try to let out a fart to see if that helps. Hmm, feels like I better not push too hard to try and get that out.

&#x200B;

5 minutes until my destination and circumstances are getting worse. I'm shifting in my chair to try and get comfy, the urge to go is getting pretty urgent. I look for somewhere to stop that might have a bathroom but nowhere looks promising. Consider pulling over and running behind a tree or something but stuck in slow moving traffic so decide to clench and push on.

&#x200B;

Pulling in to the car park, I try to park as close to the store as I could and get ready to literally run through the store to their bathroom. I park and lean over to the passenger footwell to pick up my jacket... That was a bad move. The lean to the side has compromised my clenched sphincter, the dam gives way and the floodgates open.

&#x200B;

I feel warm liquid fill my boxers. It stinks, but in a way there is a small relief as the intense stomach pains are almost gone.

&#x200B;

I sit there in a puddle of apple juice that had just rapidly passed through my digestive system and contemplate my options. I do what any sane man would do and call my wife:

&#x200B;

""Hello?""

&#x200B;

""Babe, I've got a problem.""

&#x200B;

""Oh no, are you OK? Have you been in a crash? Are you hurt""

&#x200B;

""No... I've shit my pants and don't know what to do...""

&#x200B;

""WHAT THE FUCK?! That's fucking hilarious! What are you a toddler?! Where are you?""

&#x200B;

""About an hour and 15 mins from home.""

&#x200B;

""Oh my God! Well, you can either go in the shop and get some trousers or drive home...""

&#x200B;

At this point, she's still taking the piss out of me but I'm quickly distracted my an all too suddenly familiar feeling in my stomach... Round two.

&#x200B;

""Oh no, there's more coming out!""

&#x200B;

""What the fuck, are you actually shitting yourself right now?!""

&#x200B;

""Urgh...its disgusting. I can't stop it! ""

&#x200B;

Now round one was just a preview, round two was the full show. It was pure liquid shit gushing out of my ass and there was nothing I could do to stem the flow.

&#x200B;

I end up just making weird noises and have lost off ability to communicate. Imagine the worst shit you've ever had but you're sitting down in a car seat whilst doing it and your wife is listening via the hands free.

&#x200B;

""Oh no, it's breached the waistband!""

&#x200B;

Up until this point, everything had been contained in my boxers but I suddenly felt wetness creeping up my lower back and the awful smell getting stronger. If you've ever had a kid, remember those awful shits that come out the top of their nappy and all up their back? Well, that is happening to me... a 37 year old man, sitting in a company car, over an hour from home.

&#x200B;

Eventually the torrent subsides and I have no words for how I feel. I am literally sitting with my boxers full of liquid shit which has overflowed up my back. I feel exhausted and wet. I swear the entire two litres of apple juice is now in my pants. 

&#x200B;

""I'm coming home, I'm literally covered in shit.""

&#x200B;

\*retching noises from wife\*

&#x200B;

""You're repulsive. Give me a call when you're 10 mins from home"".

&#x200B;

I start the most uncomfortable drive I've ever experienced. Every gear change was creating a ripple effect with the shitty liquid. Every time I would accelerate or brake, the liquid would slosh backwards and forwards.

&#x200B;

The next issue was letting my boss know that I was going to be home early so wouldn't be able to complete my calls for the day. But what could I say?! I've just shit myself in an explosive way whilst sitting in your company car?!

&#x200B;

I say that I've been ill and am heading home. Didn't elaborate any further and he said to speak to him tomorrow morning and let him know how I was then.

&#x200B;

So I drive home, getting cold as the previously body temperature liquid was getting cooler. I call my wife when 10 mins from home and she says she's going to wait in the back garden until I've sorted myself out and she put down a bin bag in the hallway for me to stand on and strip off.

&#x200B;

I pull up outside the house and come across my latest problem...standing up. Despite 'the incident' occurring over an hour ago, there was still a lot of wetness down there and I knew that as soon as I stood up, gravity would take over.

&#x200B;

I slip off my shoes and leave them in the car, take a deep breath and go for it. As I stand up, I can feel the wetness trickling down my legs. Within seconds it's below my knees and I'm still a few steps from the front door. By the time I get there, there are drips coming out the bottom on my trouser legs, leaving a shitty bread crumb trail up my garden path.

&#x200B;

I get in the house, step on the bin bag in the hallway and close the front door behind me.

&#x200B;

You can look through my house and see the back garden from the hallway and I see my wife staring at me with her hands over her mouth is disgust. She immediately starts retching and runs off down the garden.

&#x200B;

I start to get undressed, trousers first and it is not a pretty sight. I put my boxers and trousers in the other waiting bin bag. There is no way they're getting salvaged.

&#x200B;

Next comes my top. What I had forgotten at this point was the waistband breach and the fact that my lower back was also covered.

&#x200B;

As I take my top off, I feel a wet smear going up my back and it dawns on me, there is shit on the bottom of my top and I'm not spreading it all over myself. Already in too deep, I take the top over my head and end up smearing more shit in my hair.

&#x200B;

Now naked in the hall way and literally covered from head to toe, I start using the supplied pack of baby wipes to get the worst off. I then follow the trail of bin bags up the stairs to the bathroom to shower.

&#x200B;

I have the hottest, longest shower I've ever had. I was in there for a good half hour. The initial 5 minutes was probably the worst as all the shit was accumulating in the shower tray leaving me standing in a shitty water puddle.

&#x200B;

I even used bleach to clean myself.

&#x200B;

Eventually I felt clean enough so got dressed. I went downstairs and was met with the absolute carnage I had left the hall way in. The most horrendous smell, but with a small hint of apple, and traces of shit everywhere.

&#x200B;

My wife stayed out in the garden for the next half hour whilst I sorted it out (I don't blame her, I would have done the same) before she finally came back in the house and sprayed a whole can of air freshener.

&#x200B;

She stood looking at me, a shocked look on her face and just said... ""What the actual fuck?!""

&#x200B;

I had no real explanation, I just didn't make it to the toilet in time. She asked me if I felt ill, I felt fine. She asked me what I'd had to eat and drink that day. I said I'd had nothing out of the ordinary apart from an apple juice. When I told her how much I'd drank, she just burst out laughing.

&#x200B;

""You basically drank two litres of laxative!""

&#x200B;

She then explained to me how apple juice contains high levels of frustose and should only be drunk in small quantities, hence why it is sold in smaller bottles than Coke etc. I did not know this!

&#x200B;

I then remembered the car. I had yet to see the state of this.

&#x200B;

I went out armed with a bucket of warm soapy water, bin bags, wipes and rubber gloves.

&#x200B;

The smell when opening the car door was like nothing I'd ever experienced and immediately made me retch, but I knew what had to be done.

&#x200B;

I won't go in to too much detail, but I was out there about 45 minutes and it wasn't pleasent.

&#x200B;

All of this happened 3 days ago. I'm currently having to sit on a bin bag in my car and there is still a lingering shitty, slightly apple scented smell. Any advice of cleaning car upholstery would be much appreciated! 

&#x200B;

My wife has said that this is going to take her a while to get over this! 

&#x200B;

TLDR - Drank two litres of apple juice in 10 minutes. Didn't know this would have a laxative effect. Explosively shit myself sitting in my company car whilst my wife listened on via the phone. Had to drive an hour home covered head to toe in shit.",21566
The Biggest Short: Why $AAPL Is An Overvalued Company in Decline,"Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.

While everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple‚Äôs valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.

A lot of people treat Apple like it‚Äôs the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:

>P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  
>  
>P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  
>  
>P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  
>  
>P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  
>  
>D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  
>  
>Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  
>  
>Long term debt: $93B  
>  
>TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  
>  
>TTM Earnings: $59.4B

Currently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:

>P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  
>  
>P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  
>  
>D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  
>  
>Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  
>  
>Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  
>  
>TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  
>  
>TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)

In their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.

Apple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.

The reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. 

Apple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple‚Äôs revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple‚Äôs revenue and earnings will drop even more.

Everyone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn‚Äôt as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it‚Äôs expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can‚Äôt see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Another product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they‚Äôve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they‚Äôre gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [‚Äúmocked‚Äù](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.

Apple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it‚Äôs hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That‚Äôs a pretty big risk for a company that‚Äôs been bleeding cash.

And finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple‚Äôs main advantages with their software is the fact that they don‚Äôt show ads. When this changes, Apple‚Äôs software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple‚Äôs ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it‚Äôs hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he‚Äôs full of bad takes.

As Apple‚Äôs earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. 

If they don‚Äôt halt or decrease their buyback, they‚Äôll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.

tl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it. This thing is going to come down eventually, the only question is when.",269

Falling Apple stock drags Dow Jones down 200 points,,1
Made no money because I listened to my dad,"This is my dad: [https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM](https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM)

I began investing in 2017. I wanted to buy Apple and Microsoft, but he told me they were too high, and I should wait for a crash. And he wouldn't shut up about the coming crash. I guess I internalized what he was saying and ended up focusing on ""cheap"" stocks and ""value investing.""

7 years later, my portfolio is -5%.

I didn't have enough money to buy the dip in 2020 because all of my money was tied up in stuff like $WBA, $SPG, and $SJM. Lol.

Only these past two years, I started to shift strategies and buy good businesses with actual prospects. That's why I'm down only -5% rather than -35%.

I'm just ranting. I can't believe I wasted so much time researching ""undervalued"" companies and couldn't even beat cash interest. I'm only 29 at least, so hopefully I can still grow my portfolio. But I missed out on some of the best years of the S&P...

Oh yeah, I'm holding some NVDA and yesterday my dad was screaming at me to sell, and how it's too high, and ""it can't go up forever."" I was really annoyed, so I created the image above and sent it to him.

Oh, he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years. I grew up watching my parents fight over money all the time. Don't know why I ever listened to him.

I did make plenty of my own mistakes, of course. And it's ultimately my fault for following his advice. I think I've learned a lot so I don't feel as much of a need to rely on other people anymore. I guess I'm just really annoyed that he's still saying the same thing as he did back then.

OK, thanks for listening to my venting. ",1507

"S&P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates","The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.

The S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.

All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.

Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.

But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.

""In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.

Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 ""is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,"" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.

Nutshell: GameStop fundamentals & info on Wall Street Corruption for those who saw us on Place,"**EDIT:** I wrote this up 12 hours ago, but I had trouble getting it past automod for reasons. Hopefully it's not too late to be helpful to the thousands of new folks checking us out.

This is a post for those of you who might have seen our artwork on \*place\* and are wondering why so many people are passionate about both GameStop and fighting Wall Street corruption.

First, GameStop--here are the fundamentals of the company and why I feel it's a viable investment opportunity.

Consider the following:

1. GameStop has zero debt (save for a small loan in France associated with pandemic relief)
2. $1.5 billion in cash on hand
3. rock star Chairman of the Board, Ryan Cohen, who built [chewy.com](https://chewy.com/) in his 20s and sold it for $3.4 billion in his 30s before heavily buying into GameStop in December 2020
4. new customer care center with 500 employees ([https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-hire-500-employees-new-customer-care-center-south](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-hire-500-employees-new-customer-care-center-south))
5. new warehouses in New York, Pennsylvania, and Nevada to expand fulfillment network
6. hundreds of new exec and directors from top firms, including Amazon, Target, Chewy, and Zulily ([https://gmedd.com/report-model/](https://gmedd.com/report-model/))
7. an NFT marketplace in the works, but under curtains so competition doesn't have the details--We know GameStop is working with ImmutableX (IMX) and Loopring (LRC) for this marketplace, which is why their logos are included on our \*place\* art
8. NFT marketplace that is streamlined and user friendly has great potential, esp. with NFT markets set to grow over **$40 BILLION** in the next three years ([https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/20/jefferies-sees-the-nft-market-reaching-more-than-80-billion-in-value-by-2025/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/20/jefferies-sees-the-nft-market-reaching-more-than-80-billion-in-value-by-2025/)); Also helpful: [https://hbr.org/2021/11/making-sense-of-the-nft-marketplace](https://hbr.org/2021/11/making-sense-of-the-nft-marketplace)
9. GameStop closed a number of underperforming stores over the last couple of years to trim excess and focus on high performing stores and online sales
10. complete overhaul of GameStop app in 2021 to be more user-friendly
11. the distinct lack of insider selling--in fact, insiders purchased a boatload more of the stock over the last two weeks
12. GameStop added same-day delivery for their products: [https://www.gamestop.com/collection/same-day-delivery](https://www.gamestop.com/collection/same-day-delivery)
13. GameStop just announced an upcoming vote for a stockholder dividend that will include shares from a stock split, which should ignite a price rise (possibly similar to what happened in Tesla, only with the potential to be a far more dramatic and violent rise).

**All of these changes happened in the span of a year and a half.** GameStop has set its sights on becoming a large tech company--a major player in the gaming and NFT marketplace, with partnerships including IMX, Loopring, and Pi√±ata. There's also speculation of partnerships with Microsoft, Apple, Nike, Snoop Dog, and others.

**Wall Street Corruption:**

It would be worth your time to watch the March 3 episode of ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"" on Apple TV if you have access to that streaming service. Jon breaks down the problems we here on SuperStonk have discovered. (EDIT:per u/freeleper the episode is available on YouTube as well)

1. Wall Street banks, hedge funds, market makers, etc. can sell a company ""short."" How? They borrow the stock and sell it, betting the price of the company will go down. They can then purchase the stock at a lower price and return the stock they borrowed. They pocket the change.
2. Where do they borrow stock? From people like you and me, who purchase stocks through our 401ks, pensions, or personal investments. Whoever holds your stock--be it Fidelity, Vanguard, Merrill Lynch, Chase, RobbingtheHood, etc.--they will often lend your stock out to be sold short. They do this without your knowledge, and they make money on it by charging a lending fee.
3. If you want to ensure your stock can not be lent out and is held in your name, you need to direct register your stock (DRS) with a company's official registering agent. In the case of GameStop, that is ComputerShare ([www.computershare.com](https://www.computershare.com/)). I, personally, have 100% of my GameStop shares held at ComputerShare. Direct registration means your investment is removed from Wall Street's short selling games.
4. The biggest jackpot a short seller can hit is a dying company. If they sell a company short over years, driving its price down, and never repurchase the stock (remove buy pressure) ... and if that company declares bankruptsy ... short sellers never have to repurchase the stock, and all of their gains from selling the company are exempt from capital gains tax. JACKPOT!
5. Never repurchasing the stock you borrow is called failing to deliver. (EDIT: It's one way to fail to deliver--there are others.) Fails to deliver are called FTDs, and there are literally trillions upon trillions of dollars worth of FTDs in our finacial system. ([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) If something takes down the American financial system, it will be FTDs. If you want to learn more about this, read Dr. Susanne Trimbath's book (or listen on Audible), ***Naked, Short, and Greedy.*** 
6. Short sellers targeted a number of American retail companies at the start of the pandemic, including GameStop, the p o p c o r n stock, Bed Bath & Beyond, and others. They sold more than 100% of GameStop's shares short, without repurchasing the stock. In one legal filing in a case against RobinHood in February 2021, the court alleged GameStop had 226% of its stock sold short. How can this be, you ask? Crime. Legally a stock can be sold short 120%, which is crazy even in itself.
7. So GameStop was massively sold short, but unluckily for short sellers GameStop made a massive turnaround in the past year and a half and there is zero chance of it going bankrupt. This means there are a lot of shares sold short that will eventually need to be repurchased and returned.
8. The short interest on GameStop is still believed to be more than 100%, and as high as 800%, hidden in derivatives, swaps, ETFs, DOOMPs, futures, and/or other complicated financial mechanisms. You can read all about it in the Due Diligence posts. A lot of smart people have contributed to watching for market signs of how the short interest is being held under a lid. (Hint: ETFs and swaps are a big part of it.)
9. Short sellers of GameStop have so massively dug themselves a hole that it threatens the existence of a number of financial institutions.
10. Expect high volatility in the stock price as financial institutions fight for their existance--they don't call us Diamond Hands for nothing. My hands are diamond because I've held through price fluxuations of $350 to $39, and my hands are diamond because I'm not selling my shares until the price looks like a phone number. I will also diamond hand some shares forever, and never sell them. Why? Because I like the stock, I like the company, and fuk hedge funds, banks, and this corrupt financial system.

None of this is financial advice, and I am in no way a financial advisor, but if you do decide to invest in GME, many people are registering their shares directly with [ComputerShare.com](https://computershare.com/). This prevents banks, brokers, hedge funds, and marketmakers from using the stock for short selling.

Capitalism is awesome and I love it.,"I am convinced that all of the haters of capitalism on Reddit either do not know how to benefit from capitalism or lack the self discipline to use it effectively.  

Let me start by saying that no one educated me in how to benefit from capitalism, not my public schools or universities or parents.  I learned about it from reading Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham.  I am also not rich by any stretch of the imagination and I keep my gross adjusted income below $41,675  as a single tax filer.  (Tax incentives, HSA, retirement accounts)

Why do I keep my gross adjusted income below that?  I do it so that I don‚Äôt pay long term capital gains taxes or taxes on dividends.  It also keeps my tax rates down in general.  

Now why do I love capitalism?  Because it pays me to do the things I love.  

When I want to buy something, I first put away a little bit of money into buying stock in the company that sells me that product.  Over about 15 years, I own enough stock to finance the lifestyle I desire completely from these companies.  I did this 1,000 dollars at a time over 15 years. 

 Love XBox?  I bought a couple thousand dollars of Microsoft stock here and there over time.  Now they pay me more in dividends than I spend on battle pass or games each year or a new console every couple of years.  

Same with Apple.  They pay me more than I buy from them each year.   

Same with my cell phone bill.  AT&T and VZ pay me. (I switched companies because of incentives)

Restaurants? Paid for by stock in McDonalds and other restaurant stocks.  

Gas?  Exon Mobile.  

After 15 years my entire budget for discretionary spending is paid for in its entirety by companies whose products I enjoy.  These corporations don‚Äôt own me, I own them and they pay me more than I pay them.  Now that I have reached that point I am building a nest egg and a financially independent future.  Instead of buying more stuff, I am buying more stock. 

It was a goal I set for myself coming out of college.  It took a while.  It took some sacrifice initially.  It requires discipline.  But even after only 15 years, it is awesome.",293
Congrats!!! We already won.,"How do we know we already won? Look at the manipulation up and down. If there is a so called normal stock out there, it surely does not move up 20,30,100% in a day or a few days and then hammered down, rinse and repeat. We have them and they know it and we know it. We just need to have patience and let it play out. We continue to win each day as the company is stronger with $4 billy in cash and a the fat trimmed down. If you got into Coca Cola, Apple or Amazon knowing where they are today, you would not hesitate. Just HODL and let nature take its course and feed on the corrupt. We already won and they are just bleeding out. ",312
Why Apple's Stock Traded Down Post-Q4 Earnings,,1
How to play tonight's AAPL Earnings safely,"Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple‚Äôs returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isn‚Äôt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. 

As the world‚Äôs leading consumer products and technology company, Apple‚Äôs earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? 

Here‚Äôs what analysts think:

* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)

* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv

Revenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isn‚Äôt great, but also not terrible. Something I don‚Äôt often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. [Take note of this chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3JGDWtt.png). In the quarterly revenues, we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.

Apple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn‚Äôt provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.

The information it provided earlier this year suggested that sales would drop for a second straight quarter by roughly 5%. Sales of iPads and Macs are expected to see sharp decreases ‚Äî 12% and 25.4%, respectively ‚Äî and iPhone sales also likely dropped. Analysts polled by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) expect annual declines in all of Apple‚Äôs hardware product lines.

The report comes as the PC and smartphone markets are mired in one of the worst slumps in recent years. Electronics sales are down sharply after many consumers bought new PCs and phones during the pandemic and others are tightening their belts because of high inflation or recession worries.

In the first quarter, PC shipments decreased 29%, [according to IDC](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/10/idc-worldwide-pc-shipments-fell-29-first-quarter/), while smartphone shipments were off 14%.

Apple‚Äôs report wraps up earnings season for tech‚Äôs mega-cap companies, after Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all issued results last week. All four topped analyst estimates, though growth rates were still muted compared to prior years.

While Apple isn‚Äôt immune to the broader market slowdown, some analysts hope it will show strength and resiliency because it sells premium products and has loyal customers. Refinitiv consensus estimates suggest Apple could guide back to growth. They expect 2% expansion in the third quarter. But others are concerned that revenue will keep falling, suggesting that demand for Apple‚Äôs products is eroding.

Does anyone know Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan? He mentioned in a note this week that the ""eventual outcome might be simply driven by F3Q guidance, where investors might be looking for assurance and visibility into limited downside despite a tough macro.‚Äù See, if Apple‚Äôs outlook suggests a year-over-year decline that‚Äôs less than 5%, Apple could still ‚Äútriumph‚Äù on fundamentals, at least according to Chatterjee.

Along with earnings, Apple is also likely to update investors on its [capital return authorization](https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/how-much-will-apple-spend-on-stock-buybacks-earnings-90-billion/). Analysts expect the iPhone maker to announce plans to spend as much as $90 billion on share repurchases and dividends.

**What about the Technicals?**

There isn‚Äôt a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, [but this large range looks significant](https://i.imgur.com/xcIhkg0.png). The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.

If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can‚Äôt clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.

With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.

**Valuation??**

The price of Apple is currently 28 times its one-year forward profits, which is higher than both the market average and its five-year median price of 24 times. Despite being one of the most respected companies in the world, this valuation is neither particularly high nor low. The bears don't have a good time with this fair assessment.

**What to do for Earnings?**

Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won‚Äôt be buying a new iPhone. Does this mean puts for earnings? We know the stock moves on average 5 ¬± 3% with earnings. However last quarter, it moved +7%, the one before it was +9% and the one before it was +6%. Wait, so calls? I'm thinking a strangle. I'm going to bet that while it moves on average 5%, it's going to move more, without attempting to predict whether it's going up or down. So I'll be buying AAPL 5/5 160p (at 138 bucks) and 170c (at 150 bucks). This means you can get the strangle for $288. The stock would have to move 4.6% up or 5.1% down to break even. Mind you, this post is not financial or investment advice - consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, AAPL might just stay flat.",70
The stock market should NOT bottom until $AAPL is $60,"Apple makes up almost 6% of the S&P 500 and despite the rough year for all you bag holders and virgin fund bogleheads...$AAPL is still trading at nosebleed levels.

Sure, all the meme stocks are crushed and down 90%. But there hasn't been bull capitulation yet and when stocks like $AAPL are barely getting a haircut...that doesn't mean Apple is amazing... because they're not. It means the market has a lot lower to go. 

Rates are NOT going down in 2023 so you can kiss the secular bull market goodbye. The risk free rate is increasing and whether or not we have a recession is irrelevant because inflation is still above the target of 2%. A recession will be good for inflation but it won't necessitate rate cuts. 

Why do I hate Apple? They have 16 BILLION shares outstanding and it's still trading with a market cap of 2T...this is categorically ABSURD.

The ONLY reason why $AAPL has been trading higher is the same reason why $TSLA is still insanely overvalued...a lot of stupid people are buying and holding it...just because.

You can't justify Apple's valuation here any more than the bulls could justify $SPY at $480 in January 2022.

I'll stop being a üåàüêª when Apple falls back down to earth. Until then, I'd recommend tactical asset allocation and opportunistic gambling...but Bogleheads will get rekt again in 2023.

TLDR: The market shouldn't  bottom until $AAPL gets cut in half from here.",103

Elon Musk threatens to ban iPhones over OpenAI integration,"Elon Musk threatened to ban Apple iPhones from his companies Monday, calling the tech giant‚Äôs new deal with OpenAI a security risk and escalating his long-running feuds with both companies.

Apple's suppliers are down after IP7 announcement.. not good for AAPL stock,"http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2016/09/07/apples-asia-suppliers-yawn-after-iphone-7-release/?mod=BOL_hp_blog_astw

Investors are expecting that 2016-2017 will be another period of stagnation for iPhone sales and profits. Hence the drop in Apple's suppliers' stock prices. TSMC fell 0.3% after Apple announced the iPhone 7 and they are the sole supplier of the new A10 CPU that powers the iPhone 7 --> a sign that investors think that the iPhone 7 sales will either hit or miss expectations, not exceed. 

Most are expecting something massive in September 2017, most likely VR.

PYPL vs SQ - which is the better investment?,"Both down around 80% from their all time highs, both down YTD, and both criminally undervalued.  They both peaked at around $300 during the pandemic and have a similar stock price at around $60.  Wall Street seems to hate them and there are serious concerns over a lack of innovation and Apple Pay eating their market share.  In your opinion, which one serves as the better long-term investment in the fintech space?  And are these two stocks even considered good ‚Äòvalue‚Äô investments at their current price?",23
"One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.","**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",712
Berkshire Hathaway doubles down on Apple stock and dumps IBM,,24
We spend $100K on rent and it still makes more sense than buying in SF,"My husband and I got into an argument about whether we should buy a home in the city. We did the math so maybe this will help someone else making that decision too.

We are in a very fortunate position where we can afford the crazy rent in this city. I've always been the type to want to own my primary residence because of the old convention ""when you're renting you're just building someone else's equity."" He believes that real estate is a scam. He won. Here's how the math breaks down.

*Caveat*: Yes we're incredibly lucky and privileged. This math may or may not make sense for different price ranges/neighborhoods.

The house was purchased by the owners for \~$2M in 2010, renovated and upgraded. The unit was listed for sale for \~$3M and then they took it off the market. So for our calculation, we'll assume if we are able to buy it for $2M.

***Buy***:

**Down payment**: $400K

**Loan amount**: $1.6M

**Loan term**: 20 years @ 6% interest

**Year 1 mortgage amortization**: $95K in interest, $43K in principal = $138K in mortgage + interest payments (excluding maintenance, HOA fees)

**Property Taxes**: $15K

**Savings from mortgage interest tax deductions**: -$24K

***Rent***:

Rent = $8000/month \* 12 month = $96000

Difference in cash outlay: $33K

This means, for us, we could be spending $33K more in cash if we were to buy the property as opposed to renting. Historically SF has returned 7% YoY, while the stock market returns have been \~10%, and private markets returns are even higher. Basically, we are deciding between 7% returns on $43K and 10+% compounded returns on $33K which nets out still favoring renting for us.

**EDIT: Added in mortgage interest tax deduction thanks to** u/dataman_9

**EDIT 2:** Check out the New York Times ""Is It Better to Rent or Buy"" calculator to try it for your own circumstances and situation.  

Of course your interest payments will go down over time on your mortgage, you can put a bigger down payment than we have, you can time the market, and you can always choose to buy a cheaper property and renovate. But apples to apples, if you had the choice between buying vs renting the same property, in San Francisco it might make more sense to rent for longer.

I hope this could be helpful for someone else! My only regret was not being born earlier so I could have bought property for cheaper and locked in on a 20 year mortgage at 2%, but alas I had no choice in the matter.

The market is collapsing,"
###HOW YOU LIKE THEM APPLES B*TCHES
###CRASH COMIN BABY CHUUUUU CHUUUUUU






EDIT:
AS I SAID AT THE BOTTOM , I am NOT calling the top.
 

The US economy is fucked.
Housing is slowly collapsing, rent price are also slowly declining.
Goods and services are now extremely overpriced  even when accounting for inflation.

I am a truck driver, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.

Before the pandamic and this huge rise in costs, loads were paying about 3 dollars a mile when diesel was 2-3 dollars a gallon (even 1-2 dollars in some places)
During COVID, people were getting 4-5 dollars a miles per load, while diesel was still 2-3 dollars a gallon.

Now it's about 2-3 dollars per mile, and diesel is 4-7 dollars.


Solo drivers used to dominate the road.
Now, companies are specifically seeking team only operations (2 drivers in one truck) to order to  offset the cost of the fuel and also the decline/stagnation in pay rate from brokers/shippers.

In some places in the country, truckers are barely getting enough money from the loads to cover basic expenses. 

The market does what it wants , correct.
But the collapse is coming, and it WILL NOT  be a soft landing.


the Yellow Cab trucking company was the first big one to go under, and they were not the first and won't be the last.

Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting wiped off the map for almost 2 years now. The last 2 people I worked for had to close down shop.


What does that mean for you?

Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials.
If we are losing money and work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path.

I believe real-estate,auto, entertainment, and all major stocks and the  underlying are headed to the ground in slow motion now and eventually at mach 10

I am not by any means calling the TOP here, but I am screaming Wolf.

Twitter-backer knocks billions off its value after Musk‚Äôs ‚Äògo f--- yourself‚Äô outburst,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-backer-knocks-billions-off-192028495.html

>An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (¬£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to ‚Äúgo f‚Äî yourself‚Äù.

Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (¬£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.

The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter‚Äôs billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.

Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the company, adding: ‚ÄúIf somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.‚Äù

Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire‚Äôs freewheeling personal style.

Fidelity‚Äôs valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.

The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.

However, Twitter‚Äôs own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October ‚Äì less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",934
Does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash is NOT coming anytime soon?,"I feel like there‚Äôs a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who‚Äôll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won‚Äôt happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they‚Äôre growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they‚Äôre innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can‚Äôt imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). 

I know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching ‚ÄúMaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent‚Äù are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)

With investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won‚Äôt happen?",1660

Pixel 6a Review from an Apple Sheep,"First off, I am basically the textbook definition of an Apple sheep. I am completely bought into the ""walled garden"" with many of their products and services. I upgrade my iPhone every year, watch every launch event, and talk about their superiority whenever the topic came up. I never thought I would like or want to use an Android phone again, after having multiple in years past. Then came the Pixel 6a.

After starting my own business, I realized I wanted a second phone to keep my personal life separate. My iPhone would be the work phone, since I used the camera and Apple specific apps constantly for my business. Because I had the iPhone, I didn't want or need anything super expensive for the personal phone. Nothing extremely cheap, as I am a tech person and definitely prefer more premium products, but I didn't need to spend $1,000 on something to text and run social media apps. 

I originally started looking at the iPhone SE, as it was cheaper and I would still be in the Apple ecosystem. But after watching a few reviews on it, people kept comparing it to the Pixel 6a which seemed better in many ways. I always had a special interest in the Pixel series, even as an Apple fanboy, due to the cameras and stock Android. One of my main complaints with every Android I've had has been the bloatware. 

After doing plenty of research, I saw the 6a was on sale for $350 at Target, and decided to pick one up to try it. Much to my surprise, I love it. This thing is amazing for the price (and I see it's down to $300 now? Total steal.) 

The things I like most about it:

Stock Android

The stock Android on Pixels is miles better than any bloatware-ridden Samsung phone I have ever used. This phone is incredibly fast, smooth, and feature-rich without a million random pre-installed apps. I love the Material You customization and the Google assistant integration (which is miles ahead of Siri.) 

The Camera

While it does have the older Pixel camera set-up, and you can definitely tell in some conditions, the camera on this little guy packs quite the punch. I've especially noticed this with close-up shots, I did some macro comparisons with my 14PM, and the Pixel was much clearer with better color. The portrait mode is nice, it has that artificial feel to it, but so do the iPhones. The astrophotography mode is fantastic, and even the normal night mode does a good job. Also, the magic eraser feature is insanely good. I showed it to a couple of my friends and they couldn't believe it.

The Haptics

While I'm a big fan of Apple's haptics, I have to say I enjoy the hard-hitting haptics of the Pixel. The feedback you get while doing everything from typing to switching apps seems much more pronounced than the iPhone. This could be due to it being such a smaller and lighter phone, but the weight of this phone is a plus for me as well. It feels like nothing in my hands compared to the brick that is the iPhone.

Overall, I guess when compared with my iPhone, it shocks me that a phone this good can be priced this cheap. I've certainly enjoyed my experience with it over the past month, and am already looking at the 7 Pro for that camera set-up, seeing how much I like the cameras on the 6a. I will probably force myself to wait for at least the 7a, if not the 8 though.

 Pixel, congratulations on turning an Apple sheep into someone that now has green bubbles.",556

I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Apple Enters a Bear Market Today,"Its official as of today, Apple the last tech giant to hold out is now in a bear market. Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon entered a bear market around the March and beginning of May sell off while Apple was the last tech giant to enter a bear market. Today is the day where officially all big tech are now in a bear market. 

I read from a trader somewhere that he says he knows we hit a bottom when people are so scared that they don‚Äôt even wanna buy Apple stock anymore. Thats when we hit true capitulation.

What are your tech buys and buy targets? Today it‚Äôs looking like the market is continuing to sell off with tech leading the way down. I guess these are the kind of markets thats going to separate investors into traders and whether we see ‚Äúinvestors turn into traders and traders turn into investors‚Äù.",345
Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",2815
Sell Apple stock and start an IRA? Pay down loans? Leave it where it is?,"As a PhD student I don't have much capital to move around, but I do have a tiny nest egg of about six shares Apple stock I purchased back in 2008 when it was done to about $90 a share or so, if I remember correctly. Growth has been great, but I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps I should sell it and make the money work even harder for me. The problem is, the stock market is, as usual, always a gamble.

What would /r/personalfinance recommend? I already have a decent emergency fund, so options including tackling my student loan (payments are suspended until 2016), or starting an IRA. Or I can hold onto the stock and hope it continues to grow at a pace faster than an IRA.

The coming crash isn't what you think. It's already here.,"Going full ADHD on this so bare with me.

The market is going to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to tech/growth plays.  The tech bubble didn't kill tech, it purged the weak and rewarded the strong.  

Any debt laden companies will be on the chopping block as the only option for them will be higher interest borrowing or share dilution.  Plays like Amazon/Google/Apple/MS will also experience volatility but at the end of the day they can easily scale their pricing with inflation.  In fact one could argue these companies will do better in a high but steady inflationary landscape.    Pricing can be changed instantly and capital expenditures such as infrastructure (renewable power generation, servers, etc) will seem relatively cheap. 

Think of it this way... if we experience 15% inflation for the next 3 years that compounds to a 52% increase in the price of goods.    A stock would have to increase in price by 52% to break-even in terms of relative value/buying power.  

That said a crash can go two ways.... 

1) Traditional low inflation 80% great depression type crash.

2) 3+ year high inflationary period where stocks run flat due to interest rates trying to supress the snowballing inflation.  Don't count on 15%+ interest this time around.  The US would immediately default.  The Fed will likely begin increasing rates too tepidly which will further push the pain  down the road.

I'd argue the 2nd crash is much worse and is almost certain at this point.  It reflects a lack of faith in monetary policy/control and a permanent loss of wealth for the nation.  Since decoupling the USD from gold the USD has steadily seen it's buying power eroded.

When the market crashes it's not going to sell off entirely.  Crap meme stocks will be purged from existence and boomer companies like oil, infrastructure, renewable energy, REITS with equity financing, commercial reits and commodity plays will all rally to what will seem like astronomical heights.  It's already happening.  

1)  Housing prices are going crazy everywhere.  Partially due to supply constraints and immigration but also due to input costs and people starting to panic.  They are starting to realize if they don't get into the market now they never will.  Buying an overpriced home now will seem cheap in 3-5 years when we start to hit big inflation numbers.   

2)  Energy stocks up 20%+ in the last 3 months.  Wait until Russia screws with Ukraine and China pushes on Taiwan as the US is busy watching Russia.

3)  Companies with cash are using their war chests to acquire companies.  Sony/Bungie.  Microsoft/Activision/Blizzard.  AMD/Xilinx.  Nvidia/ARM.  This is just the beginning.  It's costing these companies 10%+ of the buying power annually to keep cash. Shareholders will demand they use it or give it back in the form of  share buybacks.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Stick with best of breed tech, buy the biggest house you can afford and lock in for as long as you can (or refinance and take out some of that new found equity and invest it into dividend plays to pay off your mortgage for you) and buy boomer stocks.",1839

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

I still can't grasp how the % of shares held by institutions can be lower than the % of the float held by institutions. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you all for challenging my thesis, and I would like to ask admins to change the flair to* ***DEBUNKED***\*. Take care guys and stay strong! :) 

***Special thanks to*** u/ikespungler ***and*** u/ravada ***for providing me with Bloomberg data.***

EDIT 4: *The only way to check whether this calculation method is right or wrong is to apply it to the blue-chip stocks. Some users already contacted me that they are willing to provide me with some data from Bloomberg Terminal, so I will try to analyze it in the following weeks.*

EDIT 3:  Here, I will try to answer some questions asked by other users.

>*Did you gather this data yourself from Bloomberg or was this data posted to Superstonk?*

*Yes, I gathered it by myself based on the Bloomberg posts, which were uploaded here and on the other GME subreddits.*

>*You acknowledge here, and other times in this post, that there are unexplained discrepancies in the data. Why did you continue with your analysis when you yourself admit that the data is incorrect?*

*To prove with simple mathematical equations that the data is wrong, and to show that the data given on Bloomberg shouldn't be understood as something without any flaws.*

>*This statement is hyperbole. There are many other logical explanations for why the data could be correct, nor did you actually provide proof of manipulation. It is well known that 13f fillings, where Bloomberg gets their ownership data, is typically inaccurate due to the requirements for when to file, could this not also be an explanation? This question needed to have been answered before analysis can be done.*

*In general, it could be, but in this case, it shouldn't be. Instead of taking data from one reporting period, I gathered data which equivalent to at least 4 quarterly filings. Even if you assume, that the data is ""delayed"" by the T+45 requirement from the last day of a reporting period it should not influence the overall picture of the results because sooner or later those missings filings have to be submitted within the filing period, thus 1.5 months later the data should be updated.*

*And actually, I explained why the data is wrong. Even if you throw out all the calculations. Assume, that my math sucks. The % of the institutional ownership and % of the float held by institutions is just simply wrong. The former can't be higher than the latter. It's simple math. Yet, after the January runup, something caused that anomaly.*

>*Most financial institutions calculate IO by using 13f filings from the SEC. Is there a particular reason you decided to compare this number to your own aggregated definition of what institutional ownership is? Could the discrepancy in numbers be caused by an improper calculation of IO from your aggregated definition compared to Bloombergs calculation?*

*I am gonna clarify that a bit. Bloomberg calculates the IO based not only on the 13F filings but also on the research (whatever is that), schedules 13D and G, SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5, the proxy statements, etc. Since I don't have access to all of those documents, it was the only possible solution to anchor the analysis on the IO presented by Bloomberg and compare its % to the Ownership Types (also from Bloomberg).*

*Going back to the aggregated definition. It is possible, that it might be wrong, but I am gonna repeat once again that was the assumption to proceed with calculations.*

*IO definition clearly states that:*

    Institutional ownership is the amount of a company‚Äôs available stock owned by mutual or pension funds, insurance companies, investment firms, private foundations, endowments or other large entities that manage funds on behalf of others. 

*Some other Reddit user mentioned, that Investment Advisors should not be included since this is not institutional ownership. It‚Äôs individual ownership held beneficially at a brokerage.*

*If that's true, and I would exclude that that type of ownership then the number of shares in circulation (according to the 2nd method) would vary between 800mln shares and 2 billion shares. The updated tables you can find below.*

# START

Hey guys,

Last time, when the new Bloomberg Terminal screenshot came out with Gamestop data, it got me thinking if the data there is reliable and can be used to prove the manipulation in the stock. So in order to do that, I analyzed every monthly Bloomberg post dating back to March 2021.

The findings are fascinating and they show that the data might have been manipulated after April 2021, or the method of calculating the Institutional ownership has completely changed. I lean more towards the former. Moreover, based on the data from Bloomberg, I can say with confidence that the number of shares on the market back in April 2021 varied between 115 million to 125 million.

I am gonna shortly present the whole process but first, you may ask why I analyzed the data up to only March 2021. Well‚Ä¶the answer to that is quite simple, I couldn‚Äôt find any more posts with Bloomberg data with older dates. Secondly, these last few Bloomberg posts depict that shares held by institutions were above the total number of outstanding shares, more precisely it was 121.74% of the outstanding share and 137.46% of float based on the filing from 25.04.2021. And the most recent one from 17.04.2022, which was available here on Superstonk, shows that institutions hold only 45.81% of total shares, and 40.17% of the float, so something happened between April 2021 and now, and I will try to analyze that.

**Hypothesis and the data**

My hypothesis is that the data is completely invalid and with the methodology described below I will try to prove it. Since there is no guidance provided by Bloomberg on how the ownership is calculated etc., I need to assume some stuff based on the general knowledge and the findings from the Internet.

I decided to write down the percentage of shares held by institutions and the top ownership type in an Excel spreadsheet, and I started calculating the number of shares based on the numbers provided by Bloomberg.

So here is the data already in the Excel spreadsheet.

[Data between 12.12.2021 and 17.04.2022](https://preview.redd.it/prk8zv7ng8z81.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15af1d51da0dd33249924d0bcb37fea7d1d43a12)

&#x200B;

[Data between 14.03.2021 and 25.04.2021](https://preview.redd.it/wptvhma2h8z81.jpg?width=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f609c56166dca02d7f0926ef3b3817d6ef2637e5)

As you can see it is quite a lot.

**CALCULATION MODEL 1**

Let‚Äôs start by calculating the number of the top ownership shares. Here in this method, I assume that there is no fuckery and the maximum number of shares existing is the number of shares outstanding, right? I mean it has to be correct. There is no stock manipulation market according to the media. <insert Cramer meme>

For all those calculations I took the number of shares outstanding in a specific period and multiplied it by the percentage of the ownership. For demonstration let‚Äôs take the filing from the 17th of April 2021. According to it, brokerages own 2.72% and that means that the number of shares held by brokerages is:

2.72% x 75,900,00 (shares outstanding) = 2 064 480.00

&#x200B;

[The data from the 17th of April 2022](https://preview.redd.it/dpttfgwnh8z81.png?width=321&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe099e00c4404492c25b778269f57c84f1959358)

Isn‚Äôt it simple?

The same methodology applies to other types of ownership. It is worth noticing that the screenshot of the filing from 17.04.2022 was cut, so I was unable to obtain the data for other types of ownership.

Okay, let‚Äôs move on. We have already numbers of shares sorted by top ownership, so let‚Äôs try to calculate the total number of shares, based on those ownership numbers and the percentage of the shares held by institutions.

How to specify which types of ownership are included in the institutional holdings. Well, it is quite obvious, we have to google it.

Boom, first google search, straight from Investopedia.

&#x200B;

[Institutional Ownership from Investopedia](https://preview.redd.it/7yg41ey3i8z81.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=42aefc693bdae48bb8d2260716b7478e329ff9ec)

Based on that I decided to include in Institutional Ownership those groups:

* Investment
* Pension
* Insurance
* Trust
* Bank
* Other
* and, Private Equity

I didn‚Äôt include brokerages, Venture Capitals (VCs), and hedge fund managers (HFMs), because brokerages can hold our shares, VCs, in the Gamestop case, may hold shares of our beloved Ryan Cohen, and the HFMs may love our stock so much that they hold it in their own personal portfolios.

Another reason for that was to give some margin error, just in case, there is something wrong in the assumptions or calculations. If we would include shares of these ownership types in the final calculation the total number of shares would be even higher, so yeah, treat it guys as a safety factor.

&#x200B;

[The results for the data from the 17th of April 2022](https://preview.redd.it/8sg9due7k8z81.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=d937115baaee1b0cb2e2747a4f2d850a078eaa4a)

In the red cells are the types of ownership included in the calculations and the number in red is the number of shares held by institutions.

You may already notice that something is wrong. Based on Investopedia, the number of shares held by institutions should be more or less equal to the number of shares held by institutional ownership types, but it is not.

Let‚Äôs omit that for now and go further with the analysis.

To calculate the total number of existing shares (Z), we need to divide the number of shares held by institutions from the top ownership table (Y) by the percentage of shares held by institutions (X).

Z = Y/X

Z = 44,196,570.00/45.81% = 96,477,996.07

so around 97mln shares. If we would include the Venture Capitals into that the number of total shares on the market would be around 135mln shares, a lot right?

I applied the same method to other dates and here are the results:

&#x200B;

[Results from 12.12.2021 to 17.04.2022](https://preview.redd.it/tg7tqk6ek8z81.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=378e7fcea49e084ebe016d86b47dfd7c1bc1e670)

&#x200B;

[Results from 30.05.2021 to 28.11.2021](https://preview.redd.it/ad9ec86hk8z81.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=730e1e65b97abc189325fc0d52e7e45f517b4618)

Here, before posting the last picture, I would like to go back to that point in which I discussed that ownership type percentage/number is not similar to the percentage of shares held by institutions. In a perfect world, where there is no stock manipulation, the percentage of the shares held by the institutions should be equal to the sum of percentages of Investment advisors, Pensions Funds, Insurance Companies, etc., but it is not. Well, obviously there is something fishy happening with the data, and the last table, in which the institutional ownership was higher than 100%, will show you that.

&#x200B;

[Results from 14.03.2021 to 25.04.2021](https://preview.redd.it/onickwc4l8z81.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=d992b9ddd74a0a65857ff4cb0908dc384fc56c87)

As you can see, based on the first calculation model the number of shares on the market is lower than the number of shares outstanding, and it makes sense. If you divide the number of the institutional shares by the number bigger than 1. It‚Äôs always gonna give you the smaller value.

Here is an example for smooth brains:

[Simple representation of how the fraction work](https://preview.redd.it/c4146mvcl8z81.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eaf3520893c38d1781855e681bf804b08ceacd3)

Thus, it proves that something is wrong with the data, and the calculation method I wanted to use from the beginning is not working for all of the time periods. It confirms that way of the data representation in Bloomberg Terminal has changed and it happened between April and May 2021. Please keep that in the back of your head. I will try to explain that a bit later.

**CALCULATION MODEL 2**

So after proving that the no-fuckery method does not work, it makes now only sense to assume that the percentage of ownership is based on the total number of shares on the market, not on the outstanding ones - that was my previous assumption.

Let‚Äôs get to it. Back in April 2021, Bloomberg Terminal showed that the percentage of shares held by institutions was equal to 121.74%, which gives 79,496,220.00 shares held only by institutions. Quite a lot right? and it is after the January sneeze when supposedly shorts had closed their positions‚Ä¶hehehe.

&#x200B;

[2nd calculation method for the data from March\/April 2021](https://preview.redd.it/gbrc8dw6m8z81.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=252a8777ac60ba6fdcfd265b5eae79d33cf77c15)

&#x200B;

So this time I assumed that the number of total shares is unknown and I can‚Äôt use shares outstanding to estimate the number of shares based on the top ownership. That was the flaw of the previous method in which I assume that the number of outstanding shares is the number of total shares on the market.

Following that logic, it gives us 79,496,220.00 held by institutions. Now, the top ownership percentage has to be used to calculate the total number of shares on the market. It is gonna be done similarly to the previous method, so we take only the numbers from the Investment Advisors, Insurance Companies, Trusts, Banks, Others, and Private Equities, and by a sum of those numbers, we will divide the number of shares held by institutions. The result should represent the total number of shares in circulation (real and phantom shares).

[Results of the 2nd calculation method for the data from March\/April 2021](https://preview.redd.it/5h3cv9vdn8z81.jpg?width=646&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65ff2603f20ede8c6684a530eda1a648cf73dd1c)

Here is an explanation based on the 25th of April 2021 data:

X ‚Äì is the number of shares held by institutions, thus:

X = 79 496 220.00

Y - is the number of total shares on the market and it is our unknown.

Let‚Äôs calculate Y:

X = 0,5929Y + 0.0170Y + 0.0273Y + 0.0486Y + 0.0134Y, so

Y = X/(0,5929+0.0170+0.0273+0.0486+0.0134)

Y = 79 496 220.00/0.6372

Y = 124 758 662.90

It means that back in April 2021 number of shares in circulation was around 125mln.

I applied the same method to other filings after April 2021 and **once again the total number of shares is smaller than the number of shares outstanding.**

[Results of the 2nd calculation method for the data from December 2021 to April 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/v1vyhyo9n8z81.jpg?width=969&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03bd5f960d77ceca41d0e6238a788423c51af79c)

&#x200B;

[Results of the 2nd calculation method for the data from May to October 2021](https://preview.redd.it/5yl207kan8z81.jpg?width=1121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0439416c70a19c07d925cc257ba3cc20d1b2a8da)

The only logical explanation for that is that the percentage of institutional ownership is completely manipulated by Bloomberg, and it all happened after April 2021, when the Institutional Ownership went suddenly from 121.74% to the level of 56%.

Here is the graph, which shows that nicely:

Look at the crossover of the red line and blue one. The red line should always stay above the blue one. To support that, please look at the % of shares held by institutions and % of float held by institutions and how it changed after April 2021.

We can clearly see that after April 2021, the percentage of float held by institutions became bigger than the % of shares held by the same body. It should be always lower, which means that the blue line in the graph should be below 1.

Here is a simple explanation of that issue:

The apples represent outstanding shares. Let‚Äôs assume that there is a number of 200 outstanding apples,  these ones everyone can trade.  In that story, there is Ryan, who is an institution and he buys 100 apples out of 200. Thus, the float (remaining apples left on the market) is 100 apples, so these are the apples that can be traded by other people.

So if the Ryan is the institutional investor and he holds 100 of those amazing apples it means that the ratio of the apples he holds to the outstanding apples is 100/200 = 0.5 = 50%, but the ratio of Ryan‚Äôs apples to the float is 100/100 = 1 = 100% because he holds 100 apples and the float is 100. Right? So it doesn‚Äôt matter how many apples Ryan holds, the percentage of his apples to the outstanding apples should be always lower than the percentage of his apples to the float. ALWAYS.

In the case of Gamestop, it is completely opposite, that‚Äôs why I think that the data by Bloomberg is rigged and not reliable‚Ä¶at least the part in which the % of shares held by institutions and % of float held by institutions are displayed.

I do believe, based on those findings, that the Top Ownership always relates to the total shares on the market and we can use those numbers to estimate for example, how many shares are held by individual investors by compiling filings from Gamestop and the data presented in Bloomberg.

If you noticed some errors in my reasonings, calculations or you just simply have questions regarding that DD please let me know. I‚Äôll do my best to answer everyone. Moreover, if there is anyone who has Bloomberg Terminal from before the January sneeze or the data of other companies, I would be really grateful to get those just to check whether my methodology can be applied to other stocks or not.

TLDR:

To summarize, the calculations show that there are at least 115 million shares available on the market and a sudden drop, which happened after April 2021, in the % of shares held by institutional investors was a simple manipulation of the data to hide the real numbers. It proves that we were and we are right about the HFs not closing their short positions, and the only way to end this blatant manipulation happening across the markets is just to buy, register and hold our shares.",14559
What is TSM's bear case?,"Is it really only the risk with China? I understand it would be horrific for TSM if Taiwan was invaded, but as someone under 20 years old, I am more than happy to bet my money on WW3 not happening.

They are miles ahead of other semiconductor producers, and out of the major producers,  they are the only one who is only a foundry. Samsung competes with Apple, therefore they prefer TSM. NVIDIA, AMD etc compete with Intel therefore they will also prefer TSM even if Intel catches up. Not to mention the CEO's of NVIDIA and AMD are also Taiwanese.

What are the other risks to this company? I've researched this quite a bit and it always comes down to ""It's an amazing company, but geopolitics"". Maybe I'm not seeing something, but this stock only seems to go upwards unless Taiwan is invaded.",121
